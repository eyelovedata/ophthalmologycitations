Design: Population-based cross-sectional study. Participants: Four thousand two hundred ninety-seven patients more than 40 years of age underwent a complete ocular examination in the context of the Egna-Neumarkt Glaucoma Study. Intervention: Ocular examinations were performed by trained, quality-controlled ophthalmologists according to a predefined standardized protocol including medical interview, blood pressure reading, applanation tonometry, computerized perimetry, and optic nerve head examination. Main Outcome Measures: Prevalences of ocular hypertension, primary open-angle glaucoma, normal-tension glaucoma, and other types of glaucoma were determined. Correlation coefficients were calculated for the association between systemic blood pressure and age-adjusted intraocular pressure (IOP) and between age and both intraocular and systemic blood pressures. Odds ratios were computed to assess the risk of primary open-angle glaucoma and normal-tension glaucoma in relation to systemic hypertension or antihypertensive medication, blood pressure levels, diastolic perfusion pressure, and a number of other cardiovascular risk factors. Results: A positive correlation was found between systemic blood pressure and IOP, and an association was found between diagnosis of primary open-angle glaucoma and systemic hypertension. Lower diastolic perfusion pressure is associated with a marked, progressive increase in the frequency of hypertensive glaucoma. No relationship was found between systemic diseases of vascular origin and glaucoma. Conclusions: Our data are in line with those reported in other recent epidemiologic studies and show that reduced diastolic perfusion pressure is an important risk factor for primary open-angle glaucoma.

To report the spectrum of fungal keratitis at Wills Eye Hospital, Philadelphia. Methods. We reviewed the records of 24 cases of culture-positive fungal keratitis treated from January 1991 to March 1999 at Wills Eye Hospital Risk factors, fungal identification, antifungal treatment, and outcomes were evaluated. Results. The study included 24 eyes (24 patients). Fourteen patients (58.3%) were female. The mean age was 59 years (range, 19-86 years). Predisposing factors included chronic ocular surface disease (41.7%), contact lens wear (29.2%), atopic disease (16.7%), topical steroid use (16.7%), and ocular trauma (8.3%). Early identification of fungal elements was achieved by staining of corneal scrapings in 18 cases (75%). Half of the cases (12 eyes) had corneal infections caused by yeast, and the other half by filamentous fungi. Candida albicans was the most commonly isolated organism (45.8%), followed by Fusarium sp (25%). Natamycin and amphotericin B were the topical antifungals most frequently used, while systemic treatment commonly used included fluconazole, ketoconazole, or itraconazole. Six patients (25%) had penetrating keratoplasty during the acute stage of infection. After a mean follow-up of nine months, 13 eyes (54.1%) had the best corrected visual acuity 20/100 or better. Conclusions. In contrast to other studies from the northern United States, we found Fusarium sp the most commonly isolated filamentous fungus. In our series, C. albicans was the most frequent cause of fungal keratitis, and a past history of ocular trauma was uncommon.","Candida albicans; Contact lens; Corneal ulcer; Fungal ocular infection; Fusarium; Keratitis; Ocular mycosis; Penetrating keratoplasty","amphotericin B; fluconazole; itraconazole; ketoconazole; natamycin; adult; aged; article; Candida albicans; disease predisposition; female; Fusarium; human; infection risk; keratitis; male; mycosis; nonhuman; priority journal; prognosis; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Antifungal Agents; Cornea; Corneal Ulcer; Eye Infections, Fungal; Female; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mycoses; Ophthalmology; Pennsylvania; Retrospective Studies; Risk Factors; Treatment Outcome",,"Cohen, E.J.; Cornea Service, Wills Eye Hospital, 900 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107, United States",,"10832689",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034126818

The HCQ group had no flare-ups. SLEPDAI scores were similar at study entry, and at conclusion the placebo group had significantly higher scores. One patient had improvement of skin lesions and another of arthritis, allowing a decrease of prednisone dose. There were no retinal effects. Three patients in the PL group flared up, two with skin rashes, one also with arthritis and uveitis, and one (previously in remission on HCQ) with hemolytic anemia, polyserositis and anti-dsDNA antibody. Toxemia was diagnosed in only three patients in the PL group (one fetal death). Comparing prednisone dosage change, we noted a decrease in the HCQ and an increase in the PL group. Delivery age and Apgar scores were higher in the HCQ group. Neonatal examination did not reveal congenital abnormalities, nor did a neuro-ophthalmological and auditory evaluation at 1.5-3 y of age. In spite of the small number of patients studied, we noted beneficial effects of HCQ during lupus pregnancy, as measured by SLEPDAI and decrease in prednisone dose with no detriment to patients' health.","Antimalarials; Hydroxychloroquine; Lupus pregnancy","antimalarial agent; DNA antibody; double stranded DNA; hydroxychloroquine; placebo; prednisone; adult; Apgar score; arthritis; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; delivery; discoid lupus erythematosus; double blind procedure; drug effect; drug safety; female; fetus death; hemolytic anemia; human; human tissue; inflammation; lupus erythematosus; neurologic examination; ophthalmology; pregnancy; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; rash; scoring system; skin defect; systemic lupus erythematosus; toxemia; treatment outcome; uveitis; Adult; Antimalarials; Double-Blind Method; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Lupus Erythematosus, Systemic; Placebos; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Complications; Pregnancy Outcome",,"Levy, R.A.; Hospital Universitario Pedro Ernesto, UERJ, Discipline of Rheumatology, Blvd 28 de Setembro 77/333, Rio de Janeiro, RJ, Brazil; email: rlevy@uerj.br",,"11434574",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034990187

Design: Prospective, clinic-based, comparative instrument validation study. Participants: Fifty-four patients (108 eyes) with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus selected after chart review from a single center to include the full spectrum of diabetic retinopathy. Methods: Nonsimultaneous 45°-field stereoscopic digital-video color images (JVN images) were obtained from three fields with the Joslin Vision Network (JVN) system before pupil dilation. Following pupil dilation, ETDRS seven standard field 35-mm stereoscopic color 30° fundus photographs (ETDRS photos) were obtained. Joslin Vision Network images and ETDRS photos were graded on a lesion-by-lesion basis by two independent, masked readers to assess ETDRS clinical level of diabetic retinopathy. An independent ophthalmology retina specialist adjudicated interreader disagreements in a masked fashion. Main Outcome Measures: Determination of ETDRS clinical level of diabetic retinopathy, timing of next ophthalmic evaluation of diabetic retinopathy, and need for prompt referral to ophthalmology specialist. Results: There was substantial agreement (κ = 0.65) between the clinical level of diabetic retinopathy assessed from the undilated JVN images and the dilated ETDRS photos. Agreement was excellent (κ = 0.87) for suggested referral to ophthalmology specialists for eye examinations. Comparison of individual lesions between the JVN images and the ETDRS photos and for interreader comparisons were comparable to the prior ETDRS study. Conclusions: Undilated digital-video images using the JVN system were comparable photographs for the determination of diabetic retinopathy level. The results validate the agreement between nonmydriatic JVN images and dilated ETDRS photographs and suggest that this digital technique may be an effective telemedicine tool for remotely determining the level of diabetic retinopathy, suggesting timing of next retinal evaluation and identifying the need for prompt referral to ophthalmology specialists. Thus, the JVN system would be an appropriate tool for facilitating increased access of diabetic patients into recommended eye evaluations, but should not be construed as a paradigm that would replace the need for comprehensive eye examinations. © 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,"adult; aged; article; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic imaging; disease severity; human; image analysis; major clinical study; pathological anatomy; priority journal; stereoscopic vision; Adult; Aged; Decision Support Techniques; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 1; Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Ophthalmology; Photography; Prospective Studies; Referral and Consultation; Retina; Signal Processing, Computer-Assisted; Telepathology",,"Aiello, L.M.; Beetham Eye Institute, Joslin Diabetes Center, 1 Joslin Place, Boston, MA 02215, United States",,"11237913",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035119376

Design: Retrospective, noncomparative case series. Participants: One hundred twenty-three children admitted from January 1987 through December 1998 for subdural hematomas of the brain secondary to abuse were included. Methods: Clinical features of eye examinations of the patients during their admission and after discharge and histopathologic observations for patients who died were retrieved from medical records and statistically analyzed. Main Outcome Measures: Visual response and pupillary response on initial examination, fundus findings, final vision, neurologic outcome of survivors, and death. Results: Ninety percent of the patients had ophthalmologic assessments. Retinal hemorrhages were detected in 83% of the examined children. The retinal hemorrhages were bilateral in 85% of affected children and varied in type and location. Nonophthalmologists missed the hemorrhages in 29% of affected patients. Poor visual response, poor pupillary response, and retinal hemorrhage correlated strongly with the demise of the child. One child who died had pigmented retinal scars from previous abuse, a condition not previously observed histopathologically to our knowledge. One fifth of the survivors had poor vision, largely the result of cerebral visual impairment. Severe neurologic impairment correlated highly with loss of vision. Conclusions: Shaken baby syndrome causes devastating injury to the brain and thus to vision. Retinal hemorrhages are extremely common, but vision loss is most often the result of brain injury. The patient's visual reaction and pupillary response on presentation showed a high correlation with survival. Good initial visual reaction was highly correlated with good final vision and neurologic outcome. According to the literature, when retinal hemorrhages are found in young children, the likelihood that abuse occurred is very high. Nonophthalmologists' difficulty in detecting retinal hemorrhages may be an important limiting factor in identifying shaken babies so they can be protected from further abuse.

Methods: The study was longitudinal and retrospective. All children (3126) born in 1982 in three Swedish municipalities have been followed from birth to ten years of age. Visual acuity was examined at the ages of 4, 5.5, 7 and 10 years. Before the age of 4, a gross examination of the eyes was performed. Results: The prevalence of ametropia in the population was 7.7%, the prevalence of strabismus 3.1%, and the prevalence of organic lesions 0.6%. Seven children (0.2%) were visually handicapped (visual acuity ≤0.3 in the better eye). Refractive errors and microtropias were mainly detected at the age of 4, when the first visual acuity test was performed, while manifest strabismus was in many cases detected before this age. With this screening and subsequent diagnosis and treatment, the prevalence of deep amblyopia (visual acuity ≤0.3) has been reduced from 2% to 0.2%. With treatment, 47% of the amblyopic children achieved a visual acuity better than 0.7. Conclusion: Visual screening is effective in detecting visual and ocular disorders. Most conditions are discovered before the age of 6. Compared to an unscreened population, the prevalence of amblyopia is greatly reduced.","Amblyopia; Children; Refractive error; Screening; Strabismus; Visual handicap","amblyopia; ametropia; article; birth; child; clinical examination; controlled study; evaluation; eye; eye disease; eye injury; follow up; health program; human; infant; longitudinal study; major clinical study; microtropia; ophthalmology; population; prevalence; priority journal; refraction error; retrospective study; strabismus; Sweden; therapy; vision test; visual acuity; visual disorder; Age Distribution; Amblyopia; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Male; Prevalence; Refraction, Ocular; Refractive Errors; Retrospective Studies; Strabismus; Sweden; Vision Screening; Visual Acuity",,"Kvarnström, G.; Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital, SE-581 85 Linköping, Sweden; email: gunkvarnstrom@hotmail.com",,"11401631",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034968398

Keratoconus affects all races, yet very little information exists as to the relative frequency in patients of different ethnic origin. We aimed to establish the incidence and severity of keratoconus in Asian and white patients. Methods. The hospital records of the ophthalmology department of a large Midlands hospital with a catchment population of approximately 900 000 (87% white, 11% Asian, 2% other) were examined retrospectively for the 10 year period from 1989 to 1998. Results. For the age group 10-44 years the prevalence of keratoconus in Asians and whites was 229 and 57 per 100 000 respectively, a relative prevalence of 4 to 1. The incidence of keratoconus in the same age group was 19.6 and 4.5 per 100 000 per year respectively, a relative incidence of 4.4 to 1. Asians were significantly younger at presentation compared with whites (mean 22.3 ± 6.5 vs 26.5 ± 8.5 years, p < 0.0001). A first corneal graft was carried out on 14% of the Asian and 15% of the white patients. Of those having grafts, Asians were significantly younger than white patients at the time of diagnosis (mean 19.1 ± 4.8 vs 25.7 ± 7.3 years, p = 0.005) and at operation (mean 21.4 ± 5.0 vs 28.7 ± 7.7 years, p = 0.004). The interval from diagnosis to operation, though shorter for Asians, was not significantly different (mean 1.8 ± 1.4 vs 2.5 ± 1.7 years, p = 0.2). Conclusion. The results show previously unrecognised racial differences in the hospital presentation of keratoconus in the UK. Compared with white patients, Asians have a fourfold increase in incidence, are younger at presentation and require corneal grafting at an earlier age.","Ethnic origin; Incidence; Keratoconus","adolescent; adult; age distribution; article; Asian; Caucasian; child; cornea transplantation; disease severity; ethnic difference; ethnology; female; human; incidence; keratoconus; major clinical study; male; medical record; ophthalmology; prevalence; race difference; retrospective study; United Kingdom",,"Pearson, A.R.; Eye Administration Unit, Leicester Royal Infirmary, Leicester LE1 5WW, United Kingdom","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11040911",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033844015

Measurements of refractive error were performed on 200 eyes of 100 subjects (aged 24.4±8.0 years) subjectively (non-cycloplegic) by one optometrist and objectively with the SRW-5000 autorefractor by a second. Repeatability was assessed by examining the differences between the seven autorefractor readings taken from each eye and by re-measuring the objective prescription of 50 eyes at a subsequent session. Although the SRW-5000 read slightly more plus than subjective refraction (mean spherical equivalent +0.16±0.44D), it was found to be highly valid (accurate) compared to subjective refraction and repeatable over the prescription range of +6.50 to -15.00D examined. The Shin-Nippon SRW-5000 autorefractor is therefore a valuable complement to subjective refraction and as it offers the advantage of a binocular open field-of-view, has a great potential benefit for accommodation research studies.

Methods-Two model drugs were administered, a peripheral vasoconstrictor (the α receptor agonist phenylephrine) and a peripheral vasodilator (the nitric oxide donor sodium nitroprusside) in stepwise increasing doses. Nine healthy young subjects were studied in a placebo controlled double masked three way crossover design. Subjects received intravenous infusions of either placebo or stepwise increasing doses of phenylephrine (0.5, 1, or 2 μg/kg/min) or sodium nitroprusside (0.5, 1, or 2 μg/kg/min). Retinal vessel diameters were measured with the new Zeiss retinal vessel analyser. Retinal leucocyte velocity, flow, and density were measured with the blue field entoptic technique. The reproducibility of measurements was assessed with coefficients of variation and intraclass correlation coefficients. Results-Placebo and phenylephrine did not influence retinal haemodynamics, although the α receptor antagonist significantly increased blood pressure. Sodium nitroprusside induced a significant increase in retinal venous and arterial diameters (p<0.001 each), leucocyte density (p=0.001), and leucocyte flow (p=0.024) despite lowering blood pressure to a significant degree. For venous and arterial vessel size measurements short term coefficients of variation were 1.3% and 2.6% and intraclass correlation coefficients were 0.98 and 0.96, respectively. The sensitivity was between 3% and 5% for retinal veins and 5% and 7% for retinal arteries. Conclusions-These data indicate that the Zeiss retinal vessel analyser is an accurate system for the assessment of retinal diameters in healthy subjects.

To survey practitioners in the tear film/dry eye field for their preferred diagnostic methods for the evaluation of the tear film and dry eye syndrome. Methods. A survey was given to 36 optometrists and 41 ophthalmologists with backgrounds in the area of tear film and dry eye syndrome to find their preferred test if only one diagnostic option was available for tear film evaluation. Second, third, and fourth choices were also recorded, as well as any additional comments. Results. Sixty-eight practitioners completed the survey. No one single test was a dominant first choice of the majority of respondents in either profession. History and/or dry eye questionnaire was the most frequent response to the question addressing the use of only one test (28%). The second most frequently chosen test was fluorescein break-up time (FBUT) (19%), followed by fluorescein staining (13%), and rose bengal (10%). The Schirmer test was most frequently included as one of the four choices (62%), although it was the first choice of only 9%. Conclusion.

Design: Retrospective nonrandomized comparative study. Patients and Interventions: A total of 121 patient records with alkali burns (n = 177 eyes) admitted to a tertiary hospital between 1987 and 1998 were reviewed. Eyes treated with a standard alkali burn treatment protocol, which included intensive topical steroids, ascorbate, citrate, and antibiotics, were compared with eyes treated by conservative management with antibiotics, and a short course of steroids. Main Outcome Measures: Time to corneal reepithelialization, final best-corrected visual acuity, and time to visual recovery, length of hospital stay, and complications were analyzed. Results: The standard protocol tended to delay corneal reepithelialization by one day (P = not significant) in eyes with grade 1 burns (n = 76) and by 2 days (P = 0.04) in grade 2 burns (n = 52), with no difference in final visual outcome. There were 37 eyes with grade 3 burns. Those treated with the standard protocol showed a trend toward more rapid corneal reepithelialization. Twenty-seven of 29 (93%) eyes with grade 3 injuries achieved a final best-corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better compared with 3 of 6 (50%) eyes not treated according to the standard protocol (P = 0.02). Eyes with grade 4 burns (n = 12), whether treated with the standard protocol or not, required 10 to 12 weeks for corneal reepithelialization. There was no statistically significant difference in final visual acuity. Conclusions: On the basis of our findings, a number of recommendations can be made for the management of alkali injuries. Patients with a grade 1 or 2 injury do not require routine admission and do not benefit from the use of intensive treatment with ascorbate and citrate. A trend toward more rapid healing and a better final visual outcome were apparent in grade 3 burns, but our standard protocol made no difference in grade 4 burns.

Low vision is associated with increased risk for depression and decreased functional status and quality of life. Decreased visual acuity, visual field loss, and occasional blurred vision are also associated with decreased quality of life. Improvements in both functional status and quality of life occur after low-vision service delivery. Conclusions. Self-reported quality of life is a significant outcome measure for low-vision rehabilitation.

To describe the health-related quality of life, measured with the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), of patients several years after the onset of optic neuritis, according to their neurologic and visual status; to assess the relationship between the NEI-VFQ subscales and clinical measures of visual function; and to assess the internal consistency reliability of the NEI-VFQ subscales. METHODS. The NEI- VFQ was administered to 244 patients 5 to 8 years after treatment for an episode of acute optic neuritis as part of the Optic Neuritis Treatment Trial. Visual acuity, visual field, contrast sensitivity, and color vision were measured at the same time as questionnaire completion. RESULTS. The NEI- VFQ scores generally were lower than those reported for a disease-free group. Reported dysfunction was greater when multiple sclerosis was present and when visual acuity was abnormal, supporting the construct validity of the NEI-VFQ. Rank correlations between the NEI-VFQ subscales and clinical measures of visual function were moderate at best. Internal consistency reliability was generally high for most of the NEI-VFQ subscales.

METHODS: A population-based survey was conducted in Singapore, an island located 1 degree north of the equator with a stable tropical climate. A disproportionate, stratified, clustered, random sampling procedure was used to select the names of 2000 Chinese people aged 40 to 79 years from the 1996 electoral register in the Tanjong Pagar district of Singapore. Selected subjects underwent a comprehensive interview and ocular examination. Pterygium was diagnosed and graded clinically as grade 1 (transparent), 2 (intermediate), and 3 (opaque). Risks factors associated with pterygium and grade 3 pterygium were evaluated with logistic regression models. RESULTS: From a total of 1717 eligible subjects, 1232 (71.8%) were examined. There were 120 people with either unilateral (n = 70) or bilateral (n = 50) pterygium, equivalent to an overall prevalence of 6.9% (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.2, 8.8) in the Chinese population aged 40 and older. The prevalence increased linearly with age (chi-square test of trend P < .001) and was higher among men than women (age-adjusted odds ratio [OR], 4.2; 95% CI, 2.5, 6.9). Men aged 70 and above had the highest overall prevalence of 25.4% (95% CI, 18.2, 19.4), but pterygium was not seen in women aged 40 to -49 years. In multivariate analysis, ptergyium was independently associated with increasing age (OR, 7.8; 95% CI, 3.2, 18.8 for persons 70 to 81 years, compared with 40 to 49 years), male sex (OR, 5.1; 95% CI, 2.9, 9.3) and certain occupations; factory workers, production workers and machine operators (OR, 3.1; 95% CI, 1.5, 6.3), as well as laborers and agricultural workers (OR, 3.3; 95% CI, 1.6, 7.0) had higher risks, compared with professionals and office workers. Grade 3 pterygium (n = 36) was also independently associated with male sex (OR, 11.6; 95% CI, 3.5, 38.6) and similar occupations but was not related to age. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of pterygium in Singapore is 7% among Chinese aged 40 years and older. Independent associations with increasing age, male sex, and occupations linked to outdoor work and other exposures suggest a multifactorial cause of this condition.

These findings are important because many such patients, as in most other practice settings, receive care that does not meet evidence-based standards. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHOD - In 42 Midwestern health centers, we surveyed 389 health providers and administrators about the barriers they faced delivering diabetes care. We report on home blood glucose monitoring, HbA1c tests, dilated eye examinations, foot examinations, diet, and exercise, all of which are a subset of the larger clinical practice recommendations of the American Diabetes Association (ADA). RESULTS - Among the 279 (72%) respondents, providers perceived that patients were significantly less likely than providers to believe that key processes of care were important (overall mean on 30-point scale: providers 26.8, patients 18.2, P = 0.0001). Providers were more confident in their ability to instruct patients on diet and exercise than on their ability to help them make changes in these areas. Ratings of the importance of access to care and finances as barriers varied widely; however, &gt;25% of the providers and administrators agreed that significant barriers included affordability of home blood glucose monitoring, HbA1c testing, dilated eye examination, and special diets; nonproximity of ophthalmologist; forgetting to order eye examinations and to examine patients' feet; time required to teach home blood glucose monitoring; and language or cultural barriers. CONCLUSIONS - Providers in health centers indicate a need to enhance behavioral change in diabetic patients. In addition, better health care delivery systems and reforms that improve the affordability, accessibility, and efficiency of care are also likely to help health centers meet ADA standards of care.",,"glucose; hemoglobin A1c; article; clinical practice; community care; cultural factor; diabetes mellitus; diet; exercise; financial management; glucose blood level; health care access; health care delivery; health care personnel; health care quality; health center; human; language; medical society; ophthalmology; patient care; patient education; patient monitoring",,"Chin, M.H.; University of Chicago, Section of General Internal Medicine, MC 2007, 5841 S.

Method: To expand the upper quadrant of the field, a high power prism segment (30-40Δ) is placed base-out across the upper part of the spectacle lens, on the side of the loss, at about the level of the limbus. A similar prism segment at the lower part of the lens is used to treat the lower field. The peripheral location of the prisms causes peripheral exotropia. As a result a scene segment as high as the vertical span of the prism is shifted laterally by 15 to 20°relative to the view of the other eye. At the edge of the hemianopic field loss, objects that would fall in the scotoma of one eye are seen through the prism in the other eye, providing a simultaneous awareness of details within the otherwise absent field-of-view. An approach for fitting the system to patients with abnormal binocular vision (strabismus and amblyopia, with or without diplopia) is discussed as well. The effect of the prisms was evaluated in a noncomparative case series (12 patients). Results: The field expansion is provided at any position of lateral gaze, including gaze away from the side of the scotoma. The effect of this technique on field expansion was demonstrated using standard binocular perimetry. Most patients reported substantial improvement in function and in obstacle avoidance. Conclusion: A novel method for the optical treatment of hemianopia was developed and tested. It was found to be effective in expanding the field and helping patients' mobility.A novel method for the optical treatment of hemianopia was developed and tested.

Our fMRI maps of ocular dominance columns are strikingly similar in appearance, size, and orientation to those reported in the literature using optical imaging of intrinsic signals (OIS) in animal cortex and histology of post-mortem human specimens. We also demonstrate that under brief visual stimulation conditions, our results are consistent over repeated experiments. This is not the case for long duration stimuli (≥10 sec). A simulated random data set exhibited the same response properties as maps obtained when using these prolonged visual stimuli. Our results suggest that brief visual stimulation is essential for fMRI to successfully resolve ocular dominance columns using the hyperoxic phase of the hemodynamic response to neural activity at our prescribed spatial resolution. © 2001 Wiley-Liss, Inc.","Biology; Brain; Diagnostic imaging; Neurosciences; Ophthalmology; Physiology","article; brain mapping; diagnostic imaging; hemispheric dominance; hemodynamics; human; human experiment; hyperoxia; nerve cell; normal human; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ophthalmology; optical resolution; priority journal; stimulus response; visual cortex; visual stimulation; Brain Mapping; Dominance, Ocular; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neurons; Photic Stimulation; Time Factors; Visual Cortex",,"Goodyear, B.G.; Seaman Family MR Research Centre, Foothills Medical Centre, 1403 29th Street NW, Calgary, Alta.

Methods: This study was an 8-week, open trial using quetiapine with 15 adolescents, ages 13-17 years, mean age 15.1 years, with a diagnosis of a psychotic disorder. Our primary instruments focused on psychotic symptomatology as measured by the Brief Psychiatric Rating Scale (BPRS), Clinical Global Impression (CGI), Positive and Negative Syndrome Scale (PANSS), and the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS). Other measures included adverse events, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, electrocardiogram (ECG), extrapyramidal (EPS) measures, and ophthalmologic examination. Results: Quetiapine significantly reduced psychotic symptoms as measured by the BPRS, PANSS, YMRS, CGI, and CGI Severity of Illness scale. The average weight gain was 4.1 kg. After correction for expected weight gain, the mean weight gain over the 8-week period was 3.4 kg. Prolactin and cholesterol remained unchanged. Trends were found for a decrease in T4 and an increase in thyroid-stimulating hormone. Common adverse effects were somnolence, agitation, drowsiness, and headache. No significant findings were noted on repeat ECGs, EPS measures, or ophthalmic examination. The final average treatment dose was 467 mg/day (range 300-800 mg/day).

Methods and Materials: Between 1989 and 1998, 68 patients were treated with FSRT (n = 63) or radiosurgery (n = 5) for pituitary adenomas. Twenty-six had functional and 42 had nonfunctional adenomas. Follow-up included CT/MRI, endocrinologic, and ophthalmologic examinations. Mean follow-up was 38.7 months. Seven patients received radiotherapy as primary treatment and 39 patients received it postoperatively for residual disease. Twenty-two patients were treated for recurrent disease after surgery. Mean total dose was 52.2 Gy for SCRT, and 15 Gy for radiosurgery. Results: Overall local tumor control was 93% (60/65 patients). Forty-three patients had stable disease based on CT/MRI, while 15 had a reduction of tumor volume. After FSRT, 26% with a functional adenoma had a complete remission and 19% had a reduction of hormonal overproduction after 34 months' mean. Two patients with STH-secreting adenomas had an endocrinologic recurrence, one with an ACTH-secreting adenoma radiologic recurrence, within 54 months. Reduction of visual acuity was seen in 4 patients and partial hypopituitarism in 3 patients. None of the patients developed brain radionecrosis or radiation-induced gliomas. Conclusion: Stereotactically guided radiotherapy is effective and safe in the treatment of pituitary adenomas to improve local control and reduce hormonal overproduction. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","Local control; Pituitary adenomas; Stereotactic radiotherapy","Disease control; Endocrinology; Ophthalmology; Surgery; Tumors; Pituitary glands; Radiotherapy; corticotropin; adult; aged; article; cancer control; cancer recurrence; cancer regression; cancer survival; controlled study; female; follow up; glioma; hormone synthesis; human; hypophysis adenoma; hypopituitarism; major clinical study; male; postoperative complication; priority journal; radiation dose; radiation dose fractionation; radiation injury; radiation necrosis; radiation response; risk assessment; school child; stereotaxic surgery; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Adenoma; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Combined Modality Therapy; Disease-Free Survival; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Germany; Humans; Life Tables; Male; Middle Aged; Neoplasm Recurrence, Local; Pituitary Irradiation; Pituitary Neoplasms; Radiosurgery; Radiotherapy Planning, Computer-Assisted; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Remission Induction; Retrospective Studies; Survival Analysis; Treatment Outcome",,"Milker-Zabel, S.; Radiologische Universitats Klinik, Abt.

Subjects and methods: For this population-based retrospective study the medical records of all residents of the district of Turku University Hospital with a diagnosis of uveitis seen at the Eye Clinic of Turku University Hospital during the years 1980-1982 and 1988 were reviewed. Results: A total of 1122 uveitis cases were identified, and 55 (4.9%) of them were children under 16 years. The incidence per 100,000 population per year for all uveitis cases in children was 4.3 (95% confidence interval [CI], 2.2 to 6.4), and the prevalence was 27.9 (95% CI, 17.1 to 38.6), which was significantly lower compared with the rates in adults (p = 0.001 for incidence and prevalence). The vast majority of children, 50 (90.9%), had anterior uveitis (AU), and the incidence and prevalence rates of AU were significantly lower than in adults (p = 0.001 for incidence and prevalence). Three (5.5%) children had posterior uveitis (PU), but there was no significant difference in the incidence and only marginally significant difference in the prevalence rate of PU in children compared with the rates in adults (p = 0.33 for incidence, and p = 0.07 for prevalence). Only one case (1.8%) was found with intermediate and one with panuveitis, but no new cases. The commonest diagnostic groups in children were AU associated with juvenile rheumatoid arthritis, idiopathic acute anterior uveitis, and idiopathic chronic anterior uveitis. Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis was found in all of the PU cases with the incidence 0.3, and the prevalence 1.1, which did not differ significantly from the rates in adults (p = 1.0 for incidence, and p = 0.48 for prevalence). Conclusion: Uveitis is rarer in children than in adults. However, in contrast to studies from tertiary referral centers, the distribution of different forms of uveitis in children in this population-based study seems to resemble the distribution in adults.","Epidemiology; Incidence; Pediatric ophthalmology; Prevalence; Uveitis","article; child; chorioretinitis; disease association; epidemiological data; female; Finland; human; infant; intermediate uveitis; iridocyclitis; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; major clinical study; male; medical record; population research; priority journal; retrospective study; uveitis; Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Finland; Hospitals, University; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Male; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Retrospective Studies; Uveitis",,"Paivonsalo-Hietanen, T.; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Turku, Kiinamyllynkatu 4-8, SF-20520 Turku, Finland",,"10726797",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0343819952

METHODS: One thousand seven hundred forty-one case reports received from spontaneous reporting systems, data from the Drug Safety Section of Roche Pharmaceuticals, and the world's literature were evaluated using the World Health Organization Causality Assessment Guide of Suspected Adverse Reactions. RESULTS: Thirty-eight different signs or symptoms of ocular abnormalities associated with isotretinoin usage have been classified as 'certain,' 'probable/likely,' 'possible,' 'unlikely,' or 'conditional/unclassifiable.' CONCLUSION: Adverse ocular side effects secondary to isotretinoin that are 'certain' include abnormal meibomian gland secretion, blepharoconjunctivitis, corneal opacities, decreased dark adaptation, decreased tolerance to contact lens, decreased vision, increased tear osmolarity, keratitis, meibomian gland atrophy, myopia, ocular discomfort, ocular sicca, photophobia, and teratogenic ocular abnormalities. Those that are 'probable/likely' are decreased color vision (reversible) and permanent loss of dark adaptation. Those that have a 'possible' association include permanent keratoconjunctivitis sicca.

To identify instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) tasks whose completion time is related to visual function in older adults. Methods. Visual function (acuity, contrast sensitivity, and useful field of view) and the time to complete 17 visual tasks of everyday life were measured in a sample of 342 older adults (mean age 71 years, range 56 to 86) recruited from eye clinics. The timed IADL (TIADL) tasks included a variety of visual activities such as reading ingredients on cans of food and instructions on medicine bottles, finding a phone number in a directory, locating items on a crowded shelf and in a drawer, and using a screwdriver. Results. Multiple regression analysis indicated that poorer scores for acuity, contrast sensitivity, and useful field of view were independently associated with longer times to complete visual TIADL tasks, even after adjusting for age, educational level, depression, and general health. Cognitive status also had a significant, independent association with timed task performance. Conclusions. Older adults' timed performance in everyday tasks is related to various aspects of visual function independent of the influences of other functional and health problems and advanced age. This suggests that TIADL tasks may eventually be useful as performance outcomes in intervention evaluations targeted at reversing vision impairment or minimizing its impact. To understand the relationship between vision impairment and TIADL task performance in older adults, cognitive impairment needs to be taken into account because it has a relatively strong and independent relationship with visual TIADL task performance.","Aging; Cognitive impairment; IADL; Vision impairment; Visual performance","Medicine; Regression analysis; Sensory feedback; Acuity; Ophthalmology; adult; aged; aging; article; cognition; controlled study; daily life activity; depression; education; female; health status; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; task performance; vision; visual acuity; visual field; visual impairment",,"Owsley, C.; Department of Ophthalmology, School of Medicine, University of Alabama, 700 S. 18th Street, Birmingham, AL 35294-0009, United States; email: owsley@eyes.uab.edu","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11384013",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035001266

There are many suggested dry eye diagnostic test batteries in the literature. However, clinicians use a wide variety of dry eye diagnostic tests in clinical practice due to a number of factors, including time constraints. In addition, there has been no systematic description of the standard of care in diagnosing dry eye in the literature. The purpose of this study is to determine the type and frequency of dry eye diagnostic tests used in various modes of ophthalmic practice across a spectrum of dry eye severity. Methods. A total of 467 patient charts (patients with a previous dry eye diagnosis) were reviewed retrospectively to determine diagnostic test frequency. In reviewing patient charts, the following tests were identified as performed or not performed: symptom assessment, fluorescein staining, tear break-up time (TBUT), Schirmer test, rose bengal staining, and 'tear assessment' (including quantity and quality of the tear meniscus). Results. Dry eye diagnostic tests were used in the following frequencies across all modes of practice: symptom assessment (82.8%), fluorescein staining (55.5%), TBUT (40.7%), tear assessment (22.2%), Schirmer test (8.5%), and rose bengal staining (4.9%). When the clinics are pooled, two test procedures were used with the highest frequency (38.9%). The most commonly performed two-test procedure combination was a symptom assessment combined with fluorescein staining of the cornea (43.7%). Conclusions. Symptom assessment plays a large role in the diagnosis of dry eye. The current clinical standard of care for dry eye diagnosis includes the performance of at least one test procedure in addition to a symptom assessment.","Diagnostic tests; Dry eye; Keratoconjunctivitis sicca; Symptoms; Tears","fluorescein; rose bengal; adult; aged; article; clinical practice; diagnostic test; disease severity; dry eye; female; fluorescence; human; major clinical study; male; medical record; priority journal; Schirmer test; staining; symptomatology; tear film; Contrast Media; Cornea; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Dry Eye Syndromes; Female; Fluorescein; Fluorescent Dyes; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmic Solutions; Ophthalmology; Retrospective Studies; Rose Bengal; Severity of Illness Index; Surface Properties; Tears",,"Nichols, K.K.; Ohio State Univ.

One basic research topic that we have studied extensively is path integration, a form of navigation in which perceived self-motion is integrated over time to obtain an estimate of current position and orientation. In experiments on pathway completion, one test of path integration ability, we have found that subjects who are passively guided over the outbound path without vision exhibit significant errors when attempting to return to the origin but are nevertheless sensitive to turns and segment lengths in the stimulus path. We have also found no major differences in path integration ability among blind and sighted populations. A model we have developed that attributes errors in path integration to errors in encoding the stimulus path is a good beginning toward understanding path integration performance. In other research on path integration, in which optic flow information was manipulated in addition to the proprioceptive and vestibular information of nonvisual locomotion, we have found that optic flow is a weak input to the path integration process. In other basic research, our studies of auditory distance perception in outdoor environments show systematic underestimation of sound source distance. Our applied research has been concerned with developing and evaluating a navigation system for the visually impaired that uses three recent technologies: the Global Positioning System, Geographic Information Systems, and virtual acoustics. Our work shows that there is considerable promise of these three technologies in allowing visually impaired individuals to navigate and learn about unfamiliar environments without the assistance of human guides.","Auditory distance perception; Blind; Geographic Information System; GIS; Global Positioning System; GPS; Navigation; Navigation system for the blind; Path integration; Spatial hearing; Virtual sound; Visually impaired","Error analysis; Optical properties; Population statistics; Sensory aids; Self-motion; Ophthalmology; article; blindness; clinical article; controlled study; distance perception; environmental factor; hearing; human; locomotion; motion; priority journal; stimulus response; task performance; technology; vestibular system; virtual reality; vision",,"Loomis, J.M.; Department of Psychology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-9660, United States; email: loomis@psych.ucsb.edu","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11384005",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034997761

To develop a reliable technique for measuring intraocular pressure (IOP) in the mouse. Methods. An electrophysiologic approach - the servo-null micropipette system (SNMS) - for measuring hydrostatic pressure was adapted for the mouse eye. Fine-tipped (5 μm in diameter) micropipettes were advanced across the cornea with a piezo-electric micromanipulator, and the IOP was continuously monitored for up to 46 minutes. Results. The micropipette tip was visualized in the anterior chamber. With the SNMS, the IOP of black Swiss outbred mice under ketamine anesthesia was 17.8 ± 0.4 mm Hg, higher than values previously estimated in inbred mouse strains by a larger bore microneedle manometric technique. After withdrawal of the micropipette, a second penetration led to a similar level of IOP. Hypotonic solutions increased and hypertonic solutions decreased IOP. Drugs that decrease inflow (acetazolamide, timolol) or increase outflow facility (pilocarpine, latanoprost) in primates and humans lowered steady state IOP in the mouse. The transient initial increase in IOP produced by pilocarpine reported in other animals was also observed in the mouse. Xylazine-ketamine anesthesia lowered IOP substantially in comparison with systemic anesthesia with either ketamine or tribromoethanol alone. Conclusions. The SNMS is the first reliable, reproducible method for measuring mouse IOP.

METHODS: Data were obtained in a cross-sectional, hospital clinic-based study, including one eye from each of 253 persons older than 40 years (68 normal, 94 glaucoma suspects and 91 glaucoma patients). We performed a comprehensive ocular examination, as well as static automated perimetry (Humphrey 24-2), screening FDT, GDx, optic nerve stereoscopic photographs and high-contrast NFL photographs. RESULTS: The following were significantly different for glaucomatous patients compared with suspects and normals: mean values of mean deviation (MD, Humphrey 24-2) and corrected pattern standard deviation (CPSD), 11 GDx indices, mean FDT testing time and missed points, and NFL graded defects (ANOVA, Mantel-Haenszel test; p = 0.0001). Using Humphrey 24-2 test results and clinical assessment as the defining features of glaucoma, we found that the optimal mix of sensitivity and specificity values were 84% and 100% for FDT (presence of any defect); 62% and 96% for GDx (The Number, cut-off value of 27); and, 95% and 82% for NFL photographs (presence of any abnormality). FDT testing took the least time to be administered. CONCLUSIONS: The FDT had the best diagnostic performance. Neural network analysis of GDx data outperformed other elements of its software.

Methods: A questionnaire was delivered to patients willing to take part, at a regular visit to their ophthalmologist, for filling in anonymously at home. A total of 589 questionnaires were returned. Results: More than 80% reported negative emotions on learning that they had glaucoma, one-third were afraid of going blind. Half the patients had no visual problem at all, 14% complained of poor or very poor vision. This proportion increased with age. One-fourth of the patients on topical medication experienced adverse effects of moderate or high degree. About half the patients being treated with laser or surgery felt their situation had improved afterwards. Nine-tenths of the individuals were satisfied with the information and care given, although their knowledge about glaucoma was rather incomplete. One-fifth missed information, mainly on causes, treatment and prognosis of the disease. The younger patients were more anxious and inquiring, reported more side effects and were less satisfied than the older patients. The women were in general more dissatisfied than the men. Conclusion: Giving a patient a diagnosis of glaucoma influences his quality of life negatively. Only half of our patients experienced any visual difficulties, whereas one-fourth reported adverse reactions due to the therapy. Most of the patients were very satisfied with the information and care given. Ophthalmologists in private practice are quite central in the management and care of the glaucoma patients in a medical setting like ours.","Glaucoma; Glaucoma management; Glaucoma treatment; Patient information; Quality of life; Questionnaire; Side effects","eye drops; adult; adverse drug reaction; age; aged; allergy; article; blindness; controlled study; depression; dyspnea; emotion; evaluation; experience; fatigue; female; gender; glaucoma; headache; home; human; information; laser surgery; major clinical study; male; Norway; ophthalmology; patient care; patient satisfaction; priority journal; private practice; prognosis; pruritus; quality of life; questionnaire; sexual dysfunction; side effect; taste; visual disorder; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Emotions; Female; Filtering Surgery; Glaucoma; Humans; Laser Surgery; Male; Middle Aged; Norway; Patient Education; Patient Satisfaction; Quality of Life; Questionnaires",,"Odberg, T.; Eye Department, Central Hospital in Hedmark, N-2326 Hamar, Norway; email: tor.odberg@c2i.net",,"11284746",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035093790

Here we summarize a few of the findings to date, with an emphasis on a direct comparison of declines in different aspects of vision function with age. The rates of declines with advancing age vary widely for the different vision functions. Also described is the reading performance of the sample and its association with some of the vision measures. Furthermore, we describe some of the associations between vision test scores and extensive longitudinal health and functioning data collected by the Buck Center for Research in Aging. Findings show that many older people with good acuity are effectively visually impaired in performing everyday tasks involving low and changing light levels, stereopsis, glare, and low contrast. We also found that vision under nonideal conditions cannot be predicted from standard acuity on an individual basis.","Aging; Elderly; Function; Impairment; Longitudinal; Performance; Population; Real-world; SKI study; Vision","Optometers; Vision; Vision function; Ophthalmology; adult; aged; aging; article; controlled study; daily life activity; elderly care; glare; health status; human; major clinical study; priority journal; reading; stereoscopic vision; task performance; vision; vision test; visual acuity; visual impairment; wellbeing",,"Brabyn, J.; Smith-Kettlewell Institute, 2318 Fillmore Street, San Francisco, CA 94115, United States; email: brabyn@ski.org","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11384002",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035001424

Previous research suggests that childhood sexual abuse is associated with high rates of retrospectively reported medical utilization and medical problems as an adult. The goal of this study was to determine if abused females have higher rates of medical utilization using self-report and objective measures, compared with non-abused females. A further goal was to determine whether findings of prior research would be replicated when childhood physical abuse level was controlled. This study also examined the moderating impact of depressed mood on current health measures in this population. Methods. Six hundred and eight women recruited from a health maintenance organization completed self-report measures of health symptoms for the previous month and doctor visits for the previous year. Objective doctor records over a 2 year period were examined for a subset of 136 of these women. Results. Results showed significantly more self-reported health symptoms and more self-reported doctor visits in abused participants compared with those who reported no childhood history of sexual abuse. Objective doctor visits demonstrated the same pattern with abused participants exhibiting more visits related to out-patient surgery and out-patient internal medicine. In addition, persons who were both sexually abused and depressed tended to visit the emergency room more frequently and to have more in-patient internal medicine and ophthalmology visits than sexually abused participants who reported low depressed mood and non-abused controls.

These results replicate prior studies and suggest that current depression may moderate the relationship between sexual abuse and medical problems in adulthood.",,"adult; adulthood; affective neurosis; aged; article; child abuse; childhood; consultation; controlled study; depression; emergency ward; female; health care utilization; health status; human; internal medicine; major clinical study; medical record; ophthalmology; outpatient; physical disease; retrospective study; self report; sexual abuse; symptomatology; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; California; Child; Child Abuse, Sexual; Comorbidity; Depressive Disorder; Emergency Service, Hospital; Female; Health Maintenance Organizations; Health Services; Humans; Middle Aged; Retrospective Studies; Somatoform Disorders; Utilization Review",,"Newman, M.G.; Department of Psychology, The Pennsylvania State University, 310 Moore Building, University Park, PA 16802-3103, United States",,"12027043",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033826250

Cycloplegic autorefraction was performed five times over ten months on 168 children aged 7, 9, and 12 years who were further divided into myopic and nonmyopic subgroups based on their initial refractive errors. Information about nearwork was obtained through diaries filled out over 24 h at the commencement of the study. Overall, myopic groups exhibited higher progression rates than nonmyopic groups. Nearwork scores derived from the diaries were generally not well correlated with overall myopia progression.Purpose: Excessive nearwork is believed to be associated with myopia development and progression. To investigate this further, we studied refractive error changes and their correlation with nearwork in a cohort of grade school children in Singapore. Methods: Cycloplegic autorefraction was performed 5 times over 10 months on 168 children aged 7, 9, and 12 years who were further divided into myopic and nonmyopic subgroups based in their initial refractive errors. Information about nearwork was obtained through diaries filled out over 24 h at the commencement of the study. Results: Myopia progression was high (overall mean: -0.87 D per year) and largely linear throughout the year, but significantly higher rates were seen after the final school examinations in 7-year-old myopes and nonmyopes. Overall, myopic groups exhibited higher progression rates than nonmyopic groups, although 33.6% of subjects from the latter groups had become myopic by the end of the study. Nearwork scores derived from the diaries were generally not well correlated with overall myopia progression. Conclusions: The tendency for myopia progression rates to increase after the final school examinations in 7-year-olds is interpreted as a delayed effect of the intense nearwork associated with preparing for them. The timing of nearwork-diary data collection at the beginning of the study could be responsible for the poor correlation between these data and overall myopia progression rates.","Epidemiology; Myopia; Myopia progression; Nearwork; Refractive error","Computer simulation; Diseases; Epidemiology; Ophthalmology; Random processes; Statistical tests; Cycloplegic autorefraction; Myopia; Myopia progression; Nearwork; Refractive error; Temporal variation; Vision; academic achievement; article; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; myopia; priority journal; refraction error; school child; Singapore",,"Balakrishnan, V.; Singapore National Eye Center, 11 Third Hospital Avenue, Singapore 0316, Singapore","Williams & Wilkins Co, Baltimore","11014673",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034282111

This study attempts to resolve whether the phenol red thread test (PRT) is a test of tear volume or tear production through comparisons with other techniques. Methods. Twenty asymptomatic subjects (10 men and 10 women; average age 30.6 ± 10.8 years) had PRT (Zone Quick, Menicon) results compared with tear turnover rate (by fluorophotometry; Fluorotron Master, OcuMetrics) and tear volumes (from tear meniscus height and back extrapolation from fluorometric data). Results. PRT wetting was not correlated with either tear turnover or volume (by fluorophotometry or tear meniscus height) on a Pearson product moment correlation test (p < 0.05). Conclusions. No clear experimental evidence in favor of the PRT being a measure of tear production or volume was found. It is probable that the PRT measures uptake of a (small) amount of fluid residing in the eye, stimulates a low degree of reflex tearing, and reflects the absorption characteristics of the thread dependent on the biophysics or composition of tears.","Phenol red thread test; Secretion; Tear volume","Absorption; Phenols; Photometry; Fluorophotometry; Vision; phenolsulfonphthalein; absorption; adult; article; biophysics; clinical examination; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; fluorophotometry; functional assessment; human; intermethod comparison; lacrimation; male; measurement; normal human; ophthalmology; priority journal; reflex; tear flow; technique",,"Tomlinson, A.; Department of Vision Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Road, Glasgow G4 0BA, United Kingdom; email: A.Tomlinson@gcal.ac.uk","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11327674",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035053660

Methods - A cross sectional study on lupus retinopathy was made in 69 patients with SLE. One expert ophthalmologist examined the ocular fundi of the lupus patients without any information of their disease state. Clinical and laboratory findings in the patients with retinopathy and those without were compared. Results - Retinopathy was found in 7/69 (10%) patients. The findings included haemorrhages, vasculitis, cotton wool spots, and hard exudates, all of which were considered to reflect vascular damage. Retinopathy was found to be associated with the presence of anticardiolipin antibody (p<0.05) and with central nervous system lupus (p<0.01). The patients with retinopathy had higher levels of serum creatinine than the patients without retinopathy (p<0.01). The disease activity of lupus, as assessed by the maximum SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) score of the patients, was also significantly Nigher in the patients with retinopathy (p<0.03).

Methods - 21 consecutive patients who had taken vigabatrin at some time in their lives were enrolled from the epilepsy clinic of the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and were compared with a group of 11 otherwise similar patients with epilepsy who had never received vigabatrin. One patient taking vigabatrin was excluded from the study because her visual field results were unreliable because of multi-infarct dementia. 15 patients were taking vigabatrin at the time of the study (VC), the other five had taken vigabatrin some time in the past (VP). Each patient underwent static perimetry using either the two point or the three point full field 120 screening program on the Humphrey visual field analyser, followed by an ophthalmic examination to rule out ocular causes for VFDs. The visual fields from each patient were then analysed using a method devised to convert the VFD into percentage defect in both eyes. In patients with known cerebral pathology that may affect the visual pathway, only the unaffected homonymous hemifield was used. Results - Nine of 20 (45%) patients in the vigabatrin group (VC and VP) complained of blurring of vision compared with two of 11 (18%) controls. Four patients (20%) in the vigabatrin group described flickering lights compared with one control (9%). None had a posterior vitreous detachment. Three of 30 (7.5%) eyes in the VC group had distant visual acuity of 6/12 or worse compared with three of 22 (9%) controls and five of 30 (16.7%) had near visual acuity worse than N6 compared with one of 22 (4.5%) in the control group. A mean of 1.73 Ishihara plates were misread in VC patients compared with 0.2 in the VP group and 0.18 in the controls. 11 of 15 (73.3%) patients in the VC group had greater than 10% VFDs as opposed to one of 11 (9.1%) controls (χ2 test, p = 0.002). In 12 of 15 (80%) VC patients the percentage VFD was greater in the nasal hemifields than the temporal hemifields compared with six of 11 (54.5%) controls. Significant correlation was found between the severity of VFD and the total dose of vigabatrin ingested for the 20 patients exposed to vigabatrin (VC and VP: Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.525; p = 0.002), for the 15 patients taking vigabatrin at the time of examination (VC: Spearman correlation coefficient = 0.568; p = 0.002). Conclusion - This pilot study suggested that epileptic patients taking vigabatrin are at much higher risk of developing VFDs compared with epileptic patients on other antiepileptic drugs. The total ingested dose of vigabatrin correlated significantly with the severity of VFDs especially in those patients who had not stopped taking vigabatrin. In our group we found that those who had taken a total dose of 1500 g or more of vigabatrin were at risk of developing significant visual field defects.",,"vigabatrin; adult; aged; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; disease severity; dose response; epilepsy; female; human; male; multiinfarct dementia; ophthalmology; perimetry; priority journal; screening test; vision; visual acuity; visual disorder; visual field defect; visual impairment; vitreous body detachment; Adult; Aged; Anticonvulsants; Case-Control Studies; Color Vision Defects; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Linear Models; Male; Middle Aged; Multivariate Analysis; Pilot Projects; Vigabatrin; Vision Disorders; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields",,"Manuchehri, I.; Birmingham Midland Eye Centre, City Hospital, Dudley Road, Birmingham B18 7QU, United Kingdom",,"10781514",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-1642618108

Setting: Ophthalmology department of 2 university teaching hospitals, Hong Kong, China. Methods: The first 44 patients with a known diagnosis of calcified IOL were recruited. Medical and ophthalmic histories were obtained. Surgical details, surgical complications, and visual acuity before and after IOL implantation were also retrieved. Patients then had a visual acuity test, a slitlamp examination of the features of the IOL calcification, and a fundus examination for clarity of view. Results: Forty-six eyes of 44 patients had IOL calcification. All had a Hydroview IOL. The onset was from 4 to 26 months after surgery. Ninety-three percent of eyes had generalized IOL calcification, and 96% had forceps marks on the IOL. Mean visual acuity deteriorated from 0.4 at 3 months to 0.13 at 19 months. Visual loss was more severe in patients with diabetes mellitus or ischemic heart disease and in those in which the IOL calcified earlier after implantation. Conclusion: All cases of IOL calcification were delayed in onset. The presence of forceps marks may provide a clue to the pathogenesis. Bilateral but asymmetric involvement in 2 patients suggests that the IOL was involved in the pathogenesis. Affected patients lost an average of 2.8 Snellen lines of visual acuity.

There is a considerable body of literature relating to trabeculectomy; however, there are no data representative of the national experience of trabeculectomy in the United Kingdom (UK). The Department of Health funded a national survey of trabeculectomy to establish current practice patterns and the outcome of trabeculectomy in the National Health Service (NHS). In this paper we report variations in surgical technique and the national success rate of trabeculectomy. Methods. A cross-sectional survey was carried out of consultant ophthalmologists performing trabeculectomy in the NHS. Participants recruited their four most recent consecutive first-time trabeculectomy cases according to study eligibility criteria and data were collected by self-administered questionnaire. Follow-up: 1 year posttrabeculectomy. Main outcome measure of success: final intraocular pressure (IOP) less than two-thirds the pre-operative IOP. Secondary outcome measures of success: final IOP less than 21 mmHg and visual field stability. Success was further defined as unqualified (excluding patients on antiglaucoma medications at final follow-up) or qualified (including patients on anti-glaucoma medications at final follow-up). The relationship between variables characterising consultants' practice and main outcome measure was examined by chi-square test. Results. Clinical outcome data were available for 1240 (85.3%) cases. There were wide variations in operative technique. The mean post-operative IOP was 14.4 mmHg (95% CI 14.2-14.7), which is a mean reduction of 11.8 mmHg (95% CI 11.4-12.2). An unqualified success, in terms of the main outcome measure, was achieved in 66.6% of patients and a qualified success in 71.0% of cases. An unqualified success, in terms of a final IOP less than 21 mmHg, was achieved in 84.0% of cases and a qualified success in 92.0%. Visual fields were stable in 84.2%. Outcome was not related to consultants' specialist interest, level of activity, type of hospital or region. Conclusions. The success rates reported in this paper represent the national experience of first-time trabeculectomy for open angle glaucoma in the UK.

Using high-resolution visual field tests, areas of residual vision can be identified which are characterized by impaired vision (relative defect) with some residual capacities. By repetitively stimulating these partially damaged areas with daily computer-based visual restitution training it is now possible to enlarge the visual field. Average border shifts of 5°(range, 0 to 20°) have been found in clinical trials, and training is effective even when started years after the injury. Visual restitution training is useful for the treatment of patients with stroke, head injury, or partial optic nerve damage, as long as the patient presents some residual vision. The improved vision is maintained in most patients after training is discontinued. Brain plasticity is likely to provide the substrate for restoration of vision, opening new opportunities to treat partial blindness, which has been considered irreversible.

The use of claims data, which include only individuals who have a diagnosis of the disorder, provides a better estimation of the clinical significance of dry eye symptoms and appraisal of community needs. Objective: The purpose of this paper is to estimate the prevalence of treated dry eye disease using a nonsurvey methodology. Methods: Patients with dry eye diagnoses or who underwent punctal occlusion procedures were identified from PharMetrics' Integrated Outcomes database of medical claims for ∼10 million patients enrolled in managed care plans. Prevalence estimates were calculated for 1997 and 1998. Results: The prevalence of dry eye was 0.48% in 1997 and 0.39% in 1998, representing 25,180 and 27,289 cases, respectively. Patients aged ≥65 years were ∼4 times as likely as those aged <65 years to be diagnosed with keratoconjunctivitis sicca or tear film insufficiency. In 1997, dry eye was diagnosed or treated in 0.65% of women compared with 0.26% of men (P < 0.001). Rates of dry eye disease in 1998 were highest among women aged 75 to 79 years (2.02%) and men aged 80 to 84 years (1.30%). Women tended to receive a diagnosis at a younger age than did men. The most common diagnosis was tear film insufficiency (73.96% and 73.41% of dry eye patients in 1997 and 1998, respectively). The most common procedure was lacrimal punctal occlusion by plug (7.78% and 8.74% of dry eye patients in 1997 and 1998, respectively). Conclusion: The prevalence of treated dry eye disease is 0.4% to 0.5% and is highest among women and the elderly.","Dry eye disease/epidemiology; Ophthalmology; Prevalence; United States/epidemiology","adult; age distribution; aged; article; data base; dry eye; female; human; keratoconjunctivitis sicca; major clinical study; male; managed care; outcomes research; prevalence; sex difference; tear film; tear film insufficiency; United States",,"Yazdani, C.; NDC Health, 2394 E.

Methods. A retrospective medical record analysis was carried out to identify patients with enophthalmos secondary to maxillary collapse. Clinical records, including ophthalmology and otolaryngology evaluations as well as computed tomography scans and operative reports, were carefully examined. A complete literature review for relevant studies was performed to examine possible pathophysiology and similar cases. Results: Four patients with enophthalmos and asymptomatic maxillary sinus disease were identified. On computed tomography, all four of the patients had opacified, partially collapsed maxillary sinuses with osteopenia of the sinus walls and orbital floor displacement resulting in enophthalmos. All four underwent successful functional endoscopic sinus surgery and transconjunctival orbital floor repair. Conclusion: In some instances, chronic maxillary atelectasis can present with enophthalmos secondary to collapse of the maxillary sinus. For reasons that are unclear, the sinus component of the disease remains asymptomatic and is discovered only after thorough evaluation of the enophthalmos.","Chronic maxillary atelectasis; Enophthalmos; Silent sinus syndrome","adult; article; atelectasis; case report; collapse; computer assisted tomography; disease course; endoscopic surgery; enophthalmos; female; human; male; maxillary sinus; ophthalmology; osteopenia; paranasal sinus disease; pathophysiology; priority journal; silent sinus syndrome; treatment outcome",,"Smith, T.L.; Div. of Rhinology and Sinus Surgery, Department of Otolaryngology, Medical College of Wisconsin, 9200 W.

In conventional static mode, the device can take up to 45 readings in 1min using digital image analysis of the reflected retinal image of a measurement ring. Continuous on-line analysis of the ring provides high (up to 60Hz) temporal resolution of the refractive state to an accuracy of <0.001D. Pupil size can also be analysed to a resolution of <0.001mm. The measurement of accommodation and pupil size was relatively unaffected by eccentricity of viewing up to ±10° and instrument focusing inaccuracies of ±5mm.

METHODS: Cluster, stratified sampling was employed to identify a cohort representative of the population of the state of Victoria aged 40 years and older that included urban, rural, and nursing home residents. A standardized personal interview and clinical eye examination, including intraocular pressure, were performed at locally established test sites. The presence of any pseudoexfoliation material on the iris or lens capsule was noted on dilated slit-lamp examination. Participants were classified as having pseudoexfoliation syndrome if any pseudoexfoliation material was present in either eye. Univariate analyses with t tests and chi-square were first employed to evaluate risk factors for pseudoexfoliation. Any factors with P < .10 were then fitted in a backward stepwise logistic regression model. For the final multivariate models, P < .05 was considered statistically significant. RESULTS: A total of 3,271 of the urban residents (83% of eligible), 403 nursing home residents (90% of eligible), and 1473 rural residents (92%) participated. The urban residents ranged in age from 40 to 98 years (mean = 59), and 1,511 (46%) were men. The nursing home residents ranged in age from 46 to 101 years (mean 82), and 85 (21%) were men. The rural residents ranged in age from 40 to 103 years (mean 60), and 701 (47.5%) were men. Participants with bilateral cataract extraction were excluded from further analyses. The overall rate of pseudoexfoliation syndrome in this population was 0.98% (95% confidence limit = 0.57, 1.28). The prevalence of pseudoexfoliation material in either eye increased significantly with age. No cases of pseudoexfoliation syndrome were observed in people aged 90 years and older. However, people with bilateral cataract surgery had been excluded from these analyses. After adjusting for age and cataract, only glaucoma remained significantly related to pseudoexfoliation (odds ratio = 3.80, 95% confidence limit = 1.73, 8.33).DISCUSSION: In conclusion, we found only two strong correlates of pseudoexfoliation in our population-based sample of Victorians aged 40 years and older: age and glaucoma.

To develop a theoretical model to predict the passive, steady-state permeability of cornea and its component layers (epithelium, stroma, and endothelium) as a function of drug size and distribution coefficient (Φ). The parameters of the model should represent physical properties that can be independently estimated and have physically interpretable meaning. Methods. A model was developed to predict corneal permeability using 1) a newly developed composite porous-medium approach to model transport through the transcellular and paracellular pathways across the epithelium and endothelium and 2) previous work on modeling corneal stroma using a fiber-matrix approach. Results. The model, which predicts corneal permeability for molecules having a broad range of size and lipophilicity, was validated by comparison with over 150 different experimental data points and showed agreement with a mean absolute fractional error of 2.43, which is within the confidence interval of the data. In addition to overall corneal permeability, the model permitted independent analysis of transcellular and paracellular pathways in epithelium, stroma and endothelium. This yielded strategies to enhance corneal permeability by targeting epithelial paracellular pathways for hydrophilic compounds (Φ < 0.1 - 1), epithelial transcellular pathways for intermediate compounds, and stromal pathways for hydrophobic compounds (Φ > 1.0 - 100). The effects of changing corneal physical properties (e.g., to mimic disease states or animals models) were also examined. Conclusions. A model based on physicochemical properties of the cornea and drug molecules can be broadly applied to predict corneal permeability and suggest strategies to enhance that permeability.","Eye; Ocular transport prediction; Ophthalmic drug delivery; Ophthalmology; Theoretical model","1,2,3,4 tetrahydro 5,8 dimethoxyisoquinoline; 6 chloro 2,3,4,5 tetrahydro 3 methyl 1h 3 benzazepine; acebutolol; agents acting on the eye; ajmaline; atenolol; clonidine; corynanthine; fluorescein; lactic acid; mannitol; metoprolol; oxprenolol; phenylephrine; phosphate; propranolol; rubidium ion; sucrose; thiocyanic acid derivative; unclassified drug; urea; article; cell membrane permeability; cornea; cornea endothelium; cornea epithelium; cornea stroma; drug delivery system; drug diffusion; drug penetration; hydrophilicity; lipophilicity; model; particle size; prediction; priority journal; steady state; Administration, Topical; Algorithms; Chemistry, Pharmaceutical; Chemistry, Physical; Cornea; Diffusion; Endothelium; Epithelium; Models, Biological; Permeability; Predictive Value of Tests; Reproducibility of Results","National Science Foundation, NSF","Edwards, A.; Department of Chemical, Tufts University, 4 Colby Street, Medford, MA 02155, United States; email: aurelie.edwards@tufts.edu",,"11758755",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034750070

METHODS: Sixty-one consecutive eyes of 47 patients with idiopathic macular hole at different stages of development were studied clinically. Patients with myopia, epiretinal macular membrane, and any other ocular disease were excluded. Best-refracted visual acuity and biomicroscopic fundus examination with macular contact lens were performed. Optical coherence tomography was performed through a dilated pupil. The optical coherence tomography findings were correlated with the Gass biomicroscopic classification of idiopathic macular hole.RESULTS: Optical coherence tomography provided different or additional information in 22 of 24 eyes (91.7%) biomicroscopically classified in stages 1-A and stage 1-B, according to the Gass macular hole classification, and in seven of 37 eyes (18.9%) biomicroscopically classified in stages 2, 3, and 4. The main difference from Gass biomicroscopic classification was a macular pseudocyst instead of a foveolar detachment in the first stages. The main additional optical coherence tomography observation, not detected biomicroscopically, was the presence of retinal tissue on the bottom of the macular hole. Optical coherence tomography may be particularly useful in evaluation of early stages in development of idiopathic macular hole. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with classic biomicroscopical observation, optical coherence tomography frequently gives different or additional information on idiopathic macular hole, especially in its early stages. Correct diagnosis and surgical indication of idiopathic macular hole may benefit from optical coherence tomography imaging.

Methods-130 infants with a gestational age (GA) <37 weeks and born between 1 November 1989 and 31 October 1990 were enrolled in a prospective study about the development of strabismus, amblyopia, and refractive errors. Infants were subdivided in three groups according to GA: A <28 weeks (n=32), B ≥28-≤32 weeks (n=64), C>32-<37 weeks (n=34). Ophthalmological assessment took place at the postconceptional age of 32 weeks, at term and at 3, 6, 12, and 30 months post term. At the age of 5 years parents received a questionnaire and a majority of the children was examined again (n=99). Results-At the age of 5 years 46 infants were known to have strabismus (n=29) and/or amblyopia (n=22) and/or refractive errors (n=22). Statistical analysis showed that gestational age, duration of supplementary oxygen, and duration of hospitalisation were important predictive variables for the development of strabismus, amblyopia, or refractive errors (SAR) at the age of 5 years (p<0.05). Infants with a GA ≤32 weeks had a significantly higher risk of developing SAR than infants with a GA >32 weeks, who developed an incidence comparable with the normal population. Strabismus developed mainly in the first year of life and at the age of 5 years. Most infants with amblyopia were detected at the age of 2-3 years. Refractive errors were found in the first year of life and at the age of 2.5 and 5 years. Conclusion-Infants with a GA <32 weeks should be selected for long term ophthalmological follow up. These infants should be screened at the age of 1 year, in the third year of life (preferably at 30 months), and just before school age (including testing of visual acuity with optotypes).",,"oxygen; amblyopia; article; astigmatism; comparative study; disease association; follow up; gestational age; human; hypermetropia; incidence; length of stay; major clinical study; medical assessment; myopia; newborn screening; onset age; ophthalmology; oxygen therapy; prematurity; preschool child; priority journal; questionnaire; refraction error; risk assessment; risk factor; statistical analysis; strabismus; Amblyopia; Analysis of Variance; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Gestational Age; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Logistic Models; Male; Netherlands; Prospective Studies; Questionnaires; Refractive Errors; Strabismus; Time Factors",,"Schalij-Delfos, N.E.; FC Donders Institute Ophthalmology, University Hospital, PO Box 85500, 3508 GA Utrecht, Netherlands; email: N.Schalijdelfos@oogh.azu.nl",,"10966945",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033833536

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - Charts were reviewed for a group of patients who were examined in 1998, followed for ≥1 year, and had two or more visits during that year. Process measures and metabolic outcomes were studied for patients with type 2 diabetes, and glycemic control was assessed for patients with type 1 diabetes. RESULTS - A total of 121 patients with type 2 diabetes had a mean age of 63 years, a mean BMI of 31 kg/m2, and a mean duration of diabetes of 12 years. Many had comorbidities or complications: 80% had hypertension, 64% had hyperlipidemia, 78% had neuropathy, 22% had retinopathy, and 21% had albuminuria. Management of type 2 diabetic patients was complex: 38% used oral hypoglycemic agents alone (54% of these were using two or more agents), 31% used oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin, and 26% used insulin alone; 42% of patients taking insulin therapy injected insulin three or more times per day. Within 12 months, 74% of patients had dilated eye examinations, 70% had lipid profiles, and 55% had urine albumin screening. Of the patients, 87% had a foot examination at their last visit. Blood pressure levels averaged 133/72 mmHg, cholesterol levels averaged 4.63 mmol/l, triglyceride levels averaged 1.99 mmol/l, HDL cholesterol levels averaged 1.24 mmol/l, and LDL cholesterol levels averaged 2.61 mmol/l. Random blood glucose levels averaged 8.0 mmol/l, and HbA(1c) levels averaged 6.9 ± 0.1%. A total of 87% of patients had HbA(1c) levels ≤8.0%. A total of 30 patients with type 1 diabetes had mean age of 44 years, a mean BMI of 26 kg/m2, and a mean duration of diabetes of 20 years. All type 1 diabetic patients used insulin and averaged 3.4 injections a day; their average HbA(1c) level was 7.1 ± 0.2%, and 80% had HbA(1c) levels ≤8.0%. CONCLUSIONS - Although endocrinologists must manage patients with multifaceted problems, complex treatment regimens yield glycemic control levels comparable with the Diabetes Control and Complications Trial and allow ADA guidelines to be met in a routine practice setting.",,"cholesterol; glucose; hemoglobin A1c; insulin; metformin; oral antidiabetic agent; troglitazone; article; blood pressure measurement; cholesterol blood level; comorbidity; diabetes control; diabetes mellitus; diabetic foot; diabetic neuropathy; diabetic retinopathy; diet therapy; endocrinology; glucose blood level; human; hyperlipidemia; hypertension; insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; insulin treatment; major clinical study; medical practice; medical society; non insulin dependent diabetes mellitus; ophthalmology; practice guideline; proteinuria; screening",,"Gebhart, S.S.P.; Diabetes Unit, Emory Clinic, 1365 Clifton Rd.

Methods and Materials: Four hundred fifty-three patients provided written informed consent and received retrobulbar RT for Graves' ophthalmopathy at Stanford University Medical Center; 197 with ≥1 year of follow-up were retrospectively analyzed. Of the 197 patients, 189 received RT to the bilateral retrobulbar regions, and 4 received unilateral RT. The technical information was unavailable for 4 patients. Patients were assessed by chart review, telephone interview, questionnaire, and multidisciplinary physician examination. Eye impairment was scored using the SPECS system. The end point review included the before and after treatment SPECS score, surgical intervention, and patient satisfaction. Potential complications, including cataract development, retinopathy, and tumor formation, were investigated. Multivariate analyses were performed to assess the prognostic variables. Results: Improvement or resolution was 89% for soft-tissue findings; 70% for proptosis; 85% for extraocular muscle dysfunction; 96% for corneal abnormalities; and 67% for sight loss. The response to RT may take >6 months to stabilize. Factors predictive of response varied in the individual SPECS categories but included the initial SPECS score, pretreatment thyroid status, female gender, a 20-Gy RT dose, and a history of hypertension. Nonpredictive factors included a history of tobacco use, diabetes mellitus, steroids, and prior cataracts. Only 16% required surgical intervention to preserve their vision or restore binocular vision. Twenty-two patients (12%) developed cataracts after irradiation (median 11 years). No patient developed a tumor within the RT field during the follow-up period (range 1-29 years). Ninety-eight percent of patients were pleased with their results, and 2% believed their symptoms progressed despite RT. Conclusions: Retrobulbar irradiation (20 Gy) is safe and effective treatment for progressive Graves' ophthalmopathy, with a 96% overall response rate, 98% patient satisfaction rate, and no irreparable long-term sequelae, with follow-up extending 29 years. The most common late effect observed was cataract development, which occurred more frequently in older patients and was reversible with extraction. Elective surgical intervention after RT should be withheld until patients have demonstrated a plateau in response. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.","Graves' ophthalmopathy; Late effects of radiation; Radiotherapy","Irradiation; Patient treatment; Radiotherapy; Tobacco; Cataracts; Ophthalmology; adolescent; adult; aged; article; carcinogenesis; cornea disease; disease course; disease marker; disease severity; exophthalmos; extraocular muscle; eye disease; female; follow up; Graves disease; human; interview; major clinical study; male; medical record; multivariate analysis; muscle disease; patient satisfaction; priority journal; prognosis; questionnaire; radiation cataract; retinopathy; soft tissue; treatment outcome; visual impairment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Analysis of Variance; Cataract; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Graves Disease; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Radiation Injuries; Radiotherapy Dosage; Regression Analysis; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome",,"Marquez, S.D.; Department of Radiation Oncology, Providence St. Joseph's Med.

The main aim of this clinical trial is to compare this new PDS foil with titanium dynamic mesh (0.3 mm) (TD), which is well established in reconstruction of the orbital floor. Patients and Methods: In a prospective multicentre randomized trial, conducted between 1997 and 1998, out of 42 patients with fractures of the orbital floor, 28 patients needing material for reconstruction were randomized to receive either PDS foil or TD. In a comprehensive preoperative and postoperative protocol patients were monitored by the surgeon, radiologist and ophthalmologist with a postoperative follow-up of least 6 months. Results: Maximum defects of the orbital floor were comparable in both groups (PDS group: 13.3 mm, TD group: 13.9 mm). In both groups the surgical procedure was well tolerated, and functional and cosmetic results were evaluated as satisfactory by all patients. Ophthalmological evaluation, performed up to 6 months postoperatively, revealed double vision or vertical strabismus in nine patients (five PDS group, four titanium group). This was not confirmed subjectively in each single patient. Also ex- or enophthalmos, registered in seven patients of the PDS and four of the TD group (mainly +/-1 mm) were not considered as relevant by the patients. Conclusion: The new 0.15 mm perforated PDS foil was comparable to 0.3 mm titanium mesh concerning functional and cosmetic outcome. Obviously, persisting ophthalmometric disorders were compensated very well in both groups. PDS foil is felt to be the preferred material since it is bioresorbable and more convenient to handle. © 2001 European Association for Cranio-Maxillofacial Surgery.",,"polydioxanone; titanium; adolescent; adult; aged; article; biodegradable implant; blowout fracture; bone remodeling; clinical article; clinical protocol; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diplopia; enophthalmos; esthetics; exophthalmos; female; foil; follow up; human; male; medical specialist; multicenter study; ophthalmology; orbit injury; patient monitoring; patient satisfaction; phase 4 clinical trial; postoperative care; preoperative care; prospective study; radiologist; randomized controlled trial; surgeon; surgical equipment; surgical technique; treatment outcome; vertical strabismus; visual disorder; visual system examination",,"Dietz, A.; Univ.-Hals-Nasen-Ohrenklinik, Dept. of Otolaryngology, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, 69120 Heidelberg, Germany","Churchill Livingstone","11465438",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035022902

By convention, a utility value of 1.0 is associated with perfect health, and a value of 0.0 is associated with death. Construct validity of utility values has been demonstrated, particularly in regard to decreasing utility values as the vision decreases in the better seeing eye, but long-term test-retest reliability has not been demonstrated. The purpose of this study was to demonstrate the test-retest reliability of ophthalmic utility values. Methods: One hundred fifteen patients with ophthalmic diseases and stable visual acuity underwent time trade-off utility analysis with retesting at various intervals ranging from 1 month to 2 years. The results were analyzed using the Wilcoxon signed rank test. The study was designed to have an 80% power, using a two-sided alpha of 5%, to be able to detect a 10% difference between the test and retest groups. Results: The mean time from testing to retesting was 0.87 years, with a median time of 1.0 year and range of 1 month to 2 years. The mean utility value in the test group was 0.766 (SD = .21; 95% CI, 0.730 - 0.802), while the mean utility value in the retest group was 0.763 (SD = .22; 95% CI, 0.724 - 0.802). The difference between the means of the test-retest groups was not significant (P=.99). The intraclass correlation between the initial and follow-up utility scores was .5246 (P<.00005). Conclusions: Ophthalmic utility values appear to have good test-retest reliability over prolonged periods of time. This information is important because it gives researchers increased confidence in the validity of basic tools for ophthalmic cost-effective (cost-utility) analyses.",,"adult; age distribution; aged; article; controlled study; correlation analysis; evaluation; eye disease; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; rank sum test; visual acuity; Wilcoxon signed ranks test; cost benefit analysis; eye disease; health status; middle aged; ophthalmology; pathophysiology; physiology; psychological aspect; quality of life; questionnaire; reproducibility; standard; statistical model; visual acuity; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Eye Diseases; Female; Health Status; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Models, Statistical; Ophthalmology; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Visual Acuity",,"Brown, G.C.; Ctr.

To assess the long-term efficacy of combined vitamin A and E treatment in preventing retinal degeneration in patients with abetalipoproteinaemia (ABL) or homozygous hypobetalipoproteinaemia (HBL). Methods. Ten patients with ABL and 3 with homozygous HBL who were treated with oral supplements of vitamins A and E were studied. Systemic, ophthalmological and electroretinographic follow-up for a mean of 11.7 years (range 4-20 years) after onset of treatment was evaluated. Results. Despite vitamin A and E treatment, 7 of 10 patients who began treatment prior to 2 years of age and all 3 patients who began treatment later in life manifested unusual fundoscopic pigmentary changes over time. At the end of follow-up, 11 of 13 patients had subnormal mixed cone-rod electroretinogram amplitudes. Seven of 10 patients for whom perimetry was available had mild to severe constriction of the visual fields. Conclusions Combined oral vitamin A and E supplementation that is initiated prior to 2 years of age can markedly attenuate the severe retinal degeneration that is associated with untreated ABL or homozygous HBL. Yet, fundoscopic and functional retinal changes do occur despite early initiation of vitamin treatment. Therefore, the adequacy of the present treatment protocol for ABL and homozygous HBL should be re-evaluated.","Abetalipoproteinaemia; Hypobetalipoproteinaemia; Retinal degeneration; Vitamin A; Vitamin E","alpha tocopherol; apolipoprotein B; retinol; abetalipoproteinemia; adolescent; adult; article; attenuation; child; clinical article; clinical protocol; controlled study; disease association; disease severity; drug efficacy; electroretinography; eye fundus; female; follow up; homozygosity; human; hypobetalipoproteinemia; male; medical assessment; ophthalmology; ophthalmoscopy; perimetry; pigment epithelium; retina cone; retina degeneration; retina rod; time; treatment outcome; visual field defect; vitamin supplementation",,"Chowers, I.; Department of Ophthalmology, Hadassah University Hospital, Hebrew University-Hadassah Med.

Methods - A randomised study with patients allocated to follow up by the hospital eye service or community optometrists was carried out in the former county of Avon in south west England. 403 patients with established or suspected primary open angle glaucoma attending Bristol Eye Hospital and meeting defined inclusion and exclusion criteria were studied. The mean number of missed points on visual field testing in the better eye (using a 'better/worse' eye analysis) in each group were measured. The visual field was measured using the Henson semiautomated central field analyser (CFA 3000). Measurements were made by the research team on all patients at baseline before randomisation and again 2 years after randomisation. The mean number of missed points on visual field testing in the worse eye, mean intraocular pressure (mm Hg), and cup disc ratio using a 'better/worse' eye analysis in each group at 2 years were also measured. Measurements were made by the research team on all patients at baseline before randomisation and again 2 years after randomisation. An analysis of covariance comparing method of follow up taking into account baseline measurements of outcome variables was carried out. Additional control was considered for age, sex, diagnostic group (glaucoma suspect/established primary open angle glaucoma), and treatment (any/none). Results - From examination of patient notes, 2780 patients with established or suspected glaucoma were identified. Of these, 752 (27.1%) fulfilled the entry criteria. For hospital and community follow up group respectively, mean number of missed points on visual field testing at 2 year follow up for better eye was 7.9 points and 6.8 points; for the worse eye 20.2 points and 18.4 points. Similarly, intraocular pressure was 19.3 mm Hg and 19.3 mm Hg (better eye), and 19.1 mm Hg and 19.0 mm Hg (worse eye); cup disc ratio at 2 year follow up was 0.72 and 0.72 (better eye), and 0.74 and 0.74 for hospital and community follow up group respectively. No significant differences in any of the key visual variables were found between the two groups before or after adjusting for baseline values and age, sex, treatment, and type of glaucoma. Conclusions - It is feasible to set and run shared care schemes for a proportion of patients with suspected and established glaucoma using community optometrists. After 2 years (a relatively short time in the life of a patient with glaucoma), there were no marked or statistically significant differences in outcome between patients followed up in the hospital eye service or by community optometrists. Decisions to implement such schemes need to be based on careful consideration of the costs of such schemes and local circumstances, including geographical access and the current organisation of glaucoma care within the hospital eye service.",,"adult; aged; article; clinical trial; community care; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; female; follow up; glaucoma; health care access; health care delivery; human; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; measurement; outpatient care; priority journal; randomized controlled trial; treatment outcome; United Kingdom; visual field; Age Distribution; Aged; Community Health Services; England; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Long-Term Care; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Optometry; Referral and Consultation; Treatment Outcome",,"Gray, S.F.; Department of Social Medicine, University of Bristol, Canynge Hall, Whiteladies Road, Bristol BS8 2PR, United Kingdom; email: selena.gray@bristol.ac.uk",,"10781507",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034059714

AMD is the leading cause of blindness in the developed world, with approximately half a million new cases of the wet form per year. The approval of Visudyne™ therapy represents a major milestone in ophthalmology since AMD was previously untreatable by any modality which would preserve existing vision. It was also a milestone in the development of PDT, not only because it represented the first breakthrough in the use of PDT to treat an otherwise untreatable condition, but also because it represented the first mass market for a PDT treatment where prospects of a substantial financial return on many years of investment appear to be likely. In this article, we look at the background to the development of BPD, primarily for its use in AMD, but also in other applications.","Age-related macular degeneration; Benzoporphyrin derivative; Laser; Photodynamic therapy; Verteporfin; Visudyne™","benzoporphyrin derivative; hematoporphyrin; hematoporphyrin derivative; photofrin; photosensitizing agent; placebo; protoporphyrin; temoporfin; actinic keratosis; animal experiment; animal model; article; autoimmune disease; blindness; cancer; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; double blind procedure; drug absorption; drug approval; drug marketing; drug mechanism; drug selectivity; drug structure; drug synthesis; human; investment; mouse; multicenter study; myopia; nonhuman; ocular histoplasmosis; ophthalmology; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; photodynamic therapy; preservation; prospective payment; psoriasis; randomized controlled trial; retina macula age related degeneration; rheumatoid arthritis; vision; Clinical Trials, Phase I; Clinical Trials, Phase II; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Photochemotherapy; Photosensitizing Agents; Porphyrins; Randomized Controlled Trials; Tissue Distribution; Treatment Outcome","Yorkshire Cancer Research","Brown, S.B.; Ctr. for Photobiol./Photodyna.

Design: Observational study of episodes of cataract surgery reported by a self-selected sample of 249 ophthalmologists. Participants: Seven thousand six hundred twenty-six patients undergoing cataract surgery during 1996 and 1997. Methods: Beginning in January 1996, participation in the AAO cataract surgery registry was offered to all ophthalmologists. Participants could use software or paper data collection forms to submit a common set of data regarding patients' demographics, preoperative ophthalmologic history, physical examination and test results, functional status and symptoms, intraoperative procedures and events, and postoperative outcomes for all patients undergoing first or second eye cataract surgery. Data were transmitted to a central database, where they were aggregated and analyzed. Findings were compared with those observed in the Cataract PORT study, which was conducted in 1991 and 1992. Results: Between January 1,1996, and February 28, 1998, 249 ophthalmologists submitted data on at least one patient who underwent cataract surgery. A total of 7626 patients undergoing first or second eye surgery were enrolled, with all preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative data forms submitted for 3342 patients (44%). The preoperative characteristics of patients reported to National Eyecare Outcomes Network (NEON) were similar to those of patients enrolled in the Cataract PORT study except for a higher reported prevalence of ocular comorbidity in NEON patients. Use of retrobulbar anesthesia was reported far less commonly, and use of topical anesthesia, phacoemulsification, and foldable intraocular lenses was reported far more often for NEON than for Cataract PORT study patients. Patient outcomes reported to NEON were similar to those observed in the Cataract PORT study. Main Outcome Measures: Visual acuity, VF-14, Cataract Symptom Score, surgical complications. Conclusions: During the first 2 years of NEON, ophthalmologist participation in the NEON cataract surgery database was low and consisted of a self-selected and likely nonrepresentative sample of ophthalmologists. The representativeness of patients for whom data were reported is unknown. In addition, complete data were submitted on only a minority of patients who were enrolled. Even so, the preoperative characteristics of patients on whom data were submitted to NEON were similar to those of patients enrolled in the Cataract PORT study. The initial experience with NEON demonstrates that it is technically possible to collect clinical data from, and report aggregated results to, practicing clinicians' offices. In addition, at least some practicing clinicians are willing to spend the time required to participate in the NEON registry. The NEON cataract surgery database thus has the potential to provide a practical means for tracking practice patterns and patient outcomes in real time. If a representative sample of physicians was willing to contribute data systematically and accurately over time, initiatives such as NEON could provide a means for professional societies and physicians to play a leadership role in defining and monitoring quality of care.

Methods: Questionnaires concerning quality of life filled in at home by 589 patients treated for chronic open angle glaucoma were correlated to corresponding questionnaires returned from their ophthalmologists. Results: Few of our patients had a visual field damage judged to be of functional significance. There was a weak to moderate association between both visual field defects and decreased visual acuity and self-reported visual difficulties. A high proportion of the patients had normal binocular visual field and a stable disease, raising the suspicion that some of them were treated for ocular hypertension. The agreement between the responses from the patients and the ophthalmologists concerning the topical treatment was good, regarding treatment duration and other diseases of the patients the agreement was moderate. Conclusion: The association between subjective visual disability and presence of visual field defects was weak to moderate in our patients treated for glaucoma, and this association was further weakened by adjusting for visual acuity. Some patients might be treated unnecessarily, and a favourable prognosis might be given to most of them.

To analyse the explanted lenses and compare them with a new lens in order to determine the cause of opacification. Methods: Two cases are presented. Both patients complained of subjective decreases in vision approximately 1 year following uneventful cataract extraction and implantation of hydrogel lenses by the same experienced surgeon in the same institution. The reduced contrast sensitivity was thought to be due to failure of the hydrogel lenses which appeared opacified at the slit-lamp. They were then exchanged for acrylic lenses. Pre- and postoperative contrast sensitivity testing was performed using the Vectorvision® CSV-1000E instrument. A detailed comparative analysis of the opacified explanted lenses and a new lens was undertaken. This included surface microscopy, infrared spectral analysis, X-ray elemental analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and electron microscopy of lens slices. Results: Lens exchange resulted in an improvement in subjective visual acuity (VA) and in objective contrast sensitivity testing. Analysis revealed deposits of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) on the explanted lens' surfaces. Conclusions: The surface of the Hydroview® H60M intraocular lens is subject to opacification as a result of calcium phosphate (hydroxyapatite) deposition, thereby limiting the patient's visual outcome, and in some cases necessitating explantation.

Methods-117 patients with low vision aged 9-101 years were assigned into three age, sex, and visual function matched groups (n = 39 in each) to answer the Low Vision Quality of Life (LVQOL) questionnaire by post, telephone, or in person. The LVQOL questionnaire was completed on four occasions, each separated by four weeks. Results-Postal implementation was the most cost effective method, showed the highest internal consistency of LVQOL items, but resulted in a lower apparent quality of life score than either telephone or in-person interviews (p<0.001). There was no difference in test-retest reliability between the three methods of implementation (p = 0.12). The profile of LVQOL scores showed a trend towards reduced quality of life scores 3 months after the baseline measures, although this was not significant. Conclusion-Posting may be the method of choice for clinical measurement of vision related quality of life. Patients with greater visual impairment were no less likely to complete a questionnaire when implemented by post and there was no apparent bias from other people assisting them. The quality of life measure can occur at any time up to 2 months after low vision rehabilitation for the progressive nature of conditions causing low vision not to cause a decreased baseline score. The LVQOL was shown to be a highly internally consistent and reliable method for measuring quality of life in the visually impaired.",,"adult; aged; article; diabetic retinopathy; female; functional assessment; health survey; human; interview; major clinical study; male; open angle glaucoma; priority journal; quality of life; questionnaire; reliability; retina macula age related degeneration; senile cataract; statistical analysis; telephone; visual impairment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Costs and Cost Analysis; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Quality of Life; Questionnaires; Vision Disorders",,"Wolffsohn, J.S.; Vision Science, Aston University, Aston Triangle, Birmingham B4 7ET, United Kingdom; email: j.s.w.wolffsohn@aston.ac.uk",,"10966961",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033833315

We performed a study to determine the test-retest reliability of the time trade-off technique for assessing utilities in patients with ocular diseases of the retina and to investigate possible factors associated with differences in utility over time. Methods: Patients referred to the retina service of a tertiary care hospital in eastern Canada were eligible for the initial interview if they had best corrected vision of 20/30 or worse in at least one eye and were deemed competent to answer the required questions. Patients were interviewed prospectively between December 1999 and March 2000 during a normal 30-minute period needed for pharmacologic mydriasis to occur. Demographic, clinical (including Snellen visual acuity) and time trade-off utility information was collected through chart review and standardized interview. Patients who completed the interview successfully were called back 28 days later for follow-up. Results: Of the 138 eligible patients 112 (81.2%) completed the initial interview. Of the 112, 96 (85.7%) completed the second interview. Half of the respondents were women, and all but one respondent were white. The mean age was 65.3 years. The primary reasons for visual loss included diabetic retinopathy (59 patients [61.4%]) and age-related macular degeneration (14 patients [14.6%]). The intraclass correlation coefficient between the initial and follow-up visual utilities was 0.7634 (95% confidence interval 0.6655-0.8355).","Ophthalmology; Reliability; Reproducibility; Retinal diseases; Time trade-off; Utilities","adult; aged; article; Canada; correlation function; diabetic retinopathy; human; major clinical study; retina disease; retina macula degeneration; visual impairment",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034941461

Methods: As part of the tutoring in ophthalmology 1996-98 Copenhagen medical students of five successive terms (in their 10th semester, n=294) were interviewed and spot-checked about their refraction. Myopia from -0.5 D was recorded and myopia onset age stated. Results: The age range was 22-41 years, median age 26. Myopia ranging from -0.5 to -8 D was encountered in 147 students (50% of all; females 53.9%, males 45%). In seven the myopia was unilateral. Median values for myopia degree and onset age were -2.5 D and 16 years in female myopia (n=89) which differed significantly from the male values (n=58) of -1.5 D and 18 years. Including the age of 18 as lower cut-off for adult-onset myopia 44.9% of the myopes belonged to this category. Conclusions: The results are in close agreement with recent Norwegian student investigations, and there is no obvious trend of a worsening of the academic myopia issue in our part of the world. This is in marked contrast to student myopia profiles as reported in Taiwan, Singapore, and Hong Kong where myopia is booming, by number and degree.","Adult-onset myopia; Myopia; Myopia epidemiology; Onset age; University students","adult; article; controlled study; Denmark; eye refraction; female; health status; Hong Kong; human; interview; major clinical study; male; medical education; medical student; myopia; Norway; onset age; ophthalmology; prevalence; priority journal; sex difference; Singapore; Taiwan; Adult; Age Distribution; Age of Onset; Denmark; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Female; Human; Male; Myopia; Prevalence; Refraction, Ocular; Sex Distribution; Students, Medical",,"Fledelius, H.C.; Rigshospitalet, University Eye Dept.

Because this is counterintuitive and because classification of notching had not been defined in the AGIS protocol, we have assessed AGIS ophthalmologists interobserver and intraobserver agreement on notching. Methods: Fourteen glaucoma subspecialists classified notching in 26 pairs of stereoscopic disc photographs of eyes with mild to severe glaucomatous optic neuropathy. They classified images as showing either no notching, notching not to the edge, or notching to the edge. Several hours later, 10 of them classified the same images a second time. Results: In an analysis of interobserver agreement, of 26 stereoscopic images, a plurality of ophthalmologists classified notching as absent in 9 (35%), as present but not to the edge in 7 (27%), and as present and to the edge in 10 (38%). All 14 ophthalmologists (100%) agreed on the classification of 7 (27%) of the images, and 13 of the 14 ophthalmologists (93%) agreed on the classification of 4 additional images (15%). Of these 11 images with at least 93% agreement, notching was reported as absent in 3 (27%) and to the edge in 8 (73%). In the remaining 15 images, there was substantial disagreement about whether notching was present and, if so, whether it was to the edge. In an analysis of intraobserver agreement, none of the 10 ophthalmologists who completed the viewing a second time classified all eyes exactly the same as the first time, though 5 ophthalmologists made 4 or fewer reclassifications. Overall, 80% of the original classifications were reproduced on second reading. Of the initial classifications that were not reproduced, slightly more than half were first classified as having notching not to the edge. Conclusion: Without definitions or examples of optic disc rim notching, the glaucoma subspecialists had relatively high intraobserver agreement but were likely to disagree with each other in characterizing the degree of disc rim notching. We recommend development of a standard photographic classification of disc rim notching. The classification should be tested for inter- and intra-observer agreement.",,"adult; aged; article; clinical observation; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; glaucoma; human; image analysis; major clinical study; medical assessment; medical specialist; optic disk; optic disk anomaly; optic disk notching; optic nerve disease; photography; priority journal; reproducibility; stereoscopic vision; time; clinical trial; female; male; medicine; middle aged; multicenter study; observer variation; open angle glaucoma; ophthalmology; optic disk; optic nerve disease; pathology; statistics; university hospital; Academic Medical Centers; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Female; Glaucoma, Open-Angle; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Observer Variation; Ophthalmology; Optic Disk; Optic Nerve Diseases; Photography; Reproducibility of Results; Specialties, Medical",,"Gaasterland, D.E.; Department of Ophthalmology, Georgetown Univ.

The drug has been shown to inhibit tumour growth and angiogenesis in a variety of preclinical models, including cancer of colon, breast, lung and intriguingly in melanoma and glioma models. Moreover, the combination of prinomastat and several chemotherapeutic agents was shown to induce additive effects. The drug is currently in Phase III clinical trials for patients with non-small cell lung cancer in combination with paclitaxel and carboplatin, as well as in advanced hormone refractory prostate cancer in combination with mitoxantrone. The most common side effects are musculoskeletal pain and stiffness. These side effects generally cease with treatment interruption.

Visual capture is an important perceptual phenomenon in which the spatial location of a visual target influences the perceived location of a related auditory target. Little is known about visual capture in a distance dimension. Methods. Two groups of listeners judged the apparent distances of five loudspeaker sound sources, extending from 1 to 5 m. In one group, each listener was allowed to view the loudspeaker array. In the second group, listeners were blindfolded for the duration of the experiment. Results. No visual capture effects were observed. Instead, the addition of vision was found to both improve distance judgment accuracy and lower judgment variability compared with the auditory-only stimulus. Auditory-only accuracy was found to substantially improve over the course of the experiment, however. Conclusions. Visual capture in distance is perhaps less general than suggested by past research, a result that has important implications for the display of spatial layout under conditions where vision is either missing or degraded.","Auditory; Mobility; Orientation; Perception; Spatial","Audition; Vision; Visual capture; Ophthalmology; adult; article; auditory stimulation; controlled study; distance perception; eye tracking; female; hearing; hearing acuity; human; human experiment; loudness; male; normal human; priority journal; sound; spatial orientation; stimulus response; task performance; vision",,"Zahorik, P.; Department of Psychology, University of California, Santa Barbara, CA 93106-9660, United States; email: zahorik@psych.ucsb.edu","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11384003",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035010118

Mean corrected reading rate fell substantially over the age range tested despite the fact that these individuals all had good acuity. However, multiple regression analysis indicated that when other measures were taken into account (most notably, low-contrast vision, motor ability, and attentional field integrity), age was not a significant independent predictor of corrected reading rate.

METHODS: In a prospective study, a complete ophthalmic examination including applanation tonometry, exophthalmometry, automated static threshold perimetry, and computed tomography of the orbit was performed in 104 consecutive Japanese patients with Graves disease (age range, 11 to 86 years; mean, 42 years; 80 women, 24 men). Ocular hypertension was defined as an intraocular pressure greater than 21 mm Hg on at least two occasions during the period of follow-up. RESULTS: Of the 104 patients, 14 (13%) exhibited typical glaucomatous visual field defects in automatic static threshold perimetry in the absence of compressive optic neuropathy. The intraocular pressure in seven of the 14 patients was consistently less than 21 mm Hg during the follow-up period. Thus, these patients were diagnosed as having normal-tension glaucoma. Of the 104 patients, 23 (22%) were diagnosed as having ocular hypertension. CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of normal-tension glaucoma as well as open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension was significantly higher among patients with Graves disease than in the general population.

Methods: Visual acuity, VA: Østerberg picture charts and reduced copies for near vision could be used in 71% of the patients. Teller preferential looking procedure was applied to people who were unable to cooperate with the picture charts. When examined with picture wall chart VA 0.3-≥0.10) was found in 10.8%, severe low vision in 1.2% (VA <0.10-≥0.05), and blindness (VA<0.05) in 3.8%. Poor near vision (<0.3) was present in 19%. Those assessed with Teller acuity cards had poorer vision than the others. It is possible that the low values of assessment with Teller cards represent a combination of gnostic and resolution deficiencies, which means that the results of grating VA and recognition VA are non-comparable. Ophthalmic Disorders The most widespread medical condition was cerebral visual impairment, the most frequent eye disorders were optic atrophy, high myopia, cataract, and keratoconus. Refraction: Refraction was assessed in 710 persons (85%), the most prevalent cause of visual impairment was uncorrected ametropia. Hypermetropia of >+1.50 was found in 151 of 710 subjects (21%), and spectacles were used by 106 (15%); myopia <-1.0 was present in 213 individuals (30%), 95 persons (13%) had lenses <-1.0. Conclusion: Resettled adult people with intellectual disability have a high prevalence of treatable visual impairment. A structured scheme of referral to optometric and ophthalmological care is essential if these people are to be given the care to which they are entitled.","Cerebral visual impairment; Eye disorders; Learning disability; Mental retardation; Spectacles; Teller cards; Visual impairment","adult; aged; article; blindness; cataract; contact lens; controlled study; deinstitutionalization; disease severity; eye refraction; female; high myopia; human; hypermetropia; intellectual impairment; keratoconus; major clinical study; male; medical assessment; myopia; ophthalmology; optic nerve atrophy; optometry; patient care; patient referral; photography; population research; prevalence; priority journal; spectacles; vision; visual acuity; visual impairment; visual memory; visual system examination; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Deinstitutionalization; Denmark; Eye Diseases; Female; Humans; Learning Disorders; Male; Mental Retardation; Middle Aged; Refraction, Ocular; Vision Disorders; Vision Tests; Visual Acuity; Visually Impaired Persons",,"Warburg, M.Ringsbjergvej 29, DK-4682 Ringsbjerg, Denmark; email: Mette.Warburg@DADLNET.dk",,"11594977",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034796690

A total of 44 Type 1 diabetic patients were subdivided into those with (n=24) and without (n=20) microangiopathy according to ophthalmological findings and the presence or absence of microalbuminuria. The control group consisted of 25 healthy people of comparable age, sex, and body mass index. Postocclusive reactive hyperemia (PORH) and thermal hyperemia (TH, at 44°C) were measured at the forearm. Serum N-acetyl-β-glucosaminidase (NAG) activity, serum E-selectin, and ICAM-1 concentrations were used as biochemical markers of endothelial dysfunction. A significantly lower velocity of perfusion increase during postocclusive hyperemia (PORHmax·t1-1) and during thermal hyperemia (THmax·t2-1) (P&lt;.01) were accompanied by higher serum NAG activity (20.9±4.6 vs. 16.3±2.5 U l-1, P&lt;.01) in diabetic patients with microangiopathy as compared to healthy persons. An inverse relationship was found between PORHmax·t1-1 and NAG (r=-.33) results in diabetic patients. In addition, higher mean values of serum NAG activity, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 concentrations were associated with significantly lower values of microcirculation parameters (PORHmax·t2-1 and THmax·t2-1) in six patients without microangiopathy who had at least one of the above biochemical markers higher than mean+2 S.D. range. We suggest that serum NAG activity, E-selectin, and ICAM-1 concentrations may be used together with laser-Doppler flowmetry in Type 1 diabetic patients as early indicators of vascular changes in very early stage of diabetic microangiopathy.

METHODS: Critical review of the current scientific and clinical literature was undertaken including appropriate statistical analyses of published data. RESULTS: Public health concerns for emergent vancomycin-resistant life-threatening 'super bugs' are legitimate. Evaluation of the risk factors that are known to promote emerging vancomycin resistance (sick patients, hospital intensive care unit setting, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clonal infections, prolonged systemic therapy, sub-therapeutic dosing, indwelling intravascular and drainage catheters, total kilogram usage and agricultural use) suggest that ophthalmic usage in routine cataract surgery is unlikely to be a significant factor in promoting emerging worldwide resistance. Clinical and scientific studies purporting to prove the value of vancomycin prophylaxis in cataract surgery contain substantial biases and design flaws that seriously undermine their validity. Issues of potential intraocular toxicity, increased costs, absence of medical-legal protection, and compliance with current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and American Academy of Ophthalmology guidelines (in hospital) mitigate against this practice. CONCLUSIONS: Ophthalmologists who use vancomycin prophylaxis in routine cataract surgery are neither the villains nor heroes according to my interpretation of the currently available scientific data. Personal conscience and an ongoing critical review of the literature should guide each ophthalmologist's choice in this controversy.

Methods: We studied eight patients suffering from different hereditary retinal dystrophies (Best's disease, reticular dystrophy, butterfly- shaped dystrophy, gyrate atrophy, and retinitis pigmentosa) who developed choroidal neovascularization. All patients underwent complete ophthalmic evaluation, electrophysiology, colour vision testing, and fluorescein angiography. In some patients, ICG video-angiography was also performed. Laser treatment was carried out in only one patient. Results: The mean duration of follow-up was 41.7 months (range 6-148 months). At CNV diagnosis, the mean VA was 0.23 (range 0.02-0.6). At the last follow-up, mean VA was 0.34 (range HM to 0.9). At the last follow-up, fluorescein angiography showed a focal, atrophic scar in seven eyes, a fibrotic membrane in two eyes and a still active membrane in two cases. Conclusion: We emphasize the relatively favourable visual prognosis in patients suffering from inherited retinal dystrophies complicated with choroidal neovascularization.

A seven-day period-prevalence survey was conducted in May 1998 in a large primary and tertiary healthcare centre in Geneva, Switzerland, that included all patients in acute, sub-acute and chronic care settings. Variables included demography, exposure to invasive devices and antibiotics, surgical history, and patients' localization. Overall prevalence of NI was 11.3% (acute, 8.4%; sub-acute, 11.4%; chronic care setting, 16.4%) in the 1928 patients studied, and ranged from 0% in ophthalmology to 23% in critical care units. Odds of infection in sub-acute and chronic care settings were significantly higher than in the acute care setting even after adjustment for case-mix [OR, 2.59; 95% confidence interval (CI95) 1.53-4.41; and OR, 2.34; CI95, 1.38-3.95, respectively]. As a distinct group, patients in the geriatric location (belonging to the sub-acute care setting) showed a significant proportion of urinary (39%) and respiratory (21%) tract infections, contrasting with a relatively low exposure to urinary catheters (6.1%) and orotracheal intubation (0%). In conclusion, sub-acute and chronic care settings are associated with high infection prevalence even after case-mix adjustment. Prevalence studies are an easy surveillance tool that can be exploited further by analysing data according to hospital care settings to identify high-risk areas. © 2001 The Hospital Infection Society.","Acquisition; Acute care; Detection; Long-term care facilities; Nosocomial infections; Prevalence","antibiotic agent; adolescent; adult; aged; article; case mix; catheterization; child; controlled study; data analysis; demography; disease association; endotracheal intubation; exposure; geriatric care; Gram negative bacterium; Gram positive bacterium; health center; health survey; high risk population; hospital care; hospital infection; human; immunosurveillance; infant; intensive care; major clinical study; ophthalmology; patient care; prevalence; primary medical care; respiratory tract infection; surgery; Switzerland; urinary tract infection",,"Pittet, D.; Infection Control Program, Department of Internal Medicine, University of Geneva Hospitals, 1211 Geneva 14, Switzerland; email: didier.pittet@hcuge.ch","W.B.

Methods: All the children born before 32 weeks gestation between 1 January 1990 and 31 December 1991 in a geographically defined population of approximately 3 million, were examined by an ophthalmologist and a paediatrician at 2 years old. Results: Five hundred and fifty-eight children (98.8% of the study group) were examined, of whom 41 had disabling CP and 13 had nondisabling CP. Children with CP had a higher incidence of abnormalities compared with children without CP: cicatricial retinopathy of prematurity occurred in 8 children with CP (14.8%) compared with 8 without CP (1.6%, p < 0.0001), cortical visual impairment occurred in 6 with CP (11.1%) compared with 1 child without CP (0.2%, p < 0.0001) and concomitant strabismus in 28 with CP (51.9%) compared with 42 without CF (8.4%, p < 0.0001). The prevalence of refractive error without other ocular abnormalities was similar for children with CP (4/54, 7.4%) and those without CP (54/504, 10.7% p = 0.90). Significant ocular abnormalities had been previously unrecognised in 8 children with CP (14.8%). Conclusion: There are some differences between these results and previous series, These differences probably reflect the fact that previous work has studied severe CP of more diverse aetiology. The high frequency of abnormalities highlights the importance of ocular assessment of these children.","Cerebral palsy; Ocular abnormalities","article; cerebral palsy; controlled study; disability; eye malformation; gestational age; human; incidence; major clinical study; ophthalmology; pediatrics; prematurity; preschool child; refraction error; retrolental fibroplasia; strabismus; visual cortex; visual impairment",,"Pennefather, P.M.; Department of Ophthalmology, Royal LiverpooI University Hospital, Prescot Street, Liverpool L7 8XP, United Kingdom","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","10755106",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034054684

Key descriptors such as hypothesis postulation, primary outcome determination, sample size calculations, and a discussion of the limitations of the study such as bias, imprecision, and internal validity are still reported in less than 42% of clinical trials. Conclusions: This study describes for the first time after the adoption of the CONSORT statement recommendations the status on the quality of reporting of recently published randomized clinical trials in Ophthalmology. Although not a direct measure of the intrinsic quality of a study, reporting quality provides the reader with useful tools for the evaluation of its validity. The quality of reporting of randomized clinical trials shows an overall improvement when compared with the period between 1991 and 1994. However, there is still significant room for improvement, especially in descriptors essential for the validation of clinical trial results that are still widely underreported. © 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,"article; medical literature; medical research; ophthalmology; outcomes research; priority journal; quality control; scoring system; validation process; Guidelines; Humans; Multicenter Studies; Ophthalmology; Publishing; Quality Control; Randomized Controlled Trials; Research Design",,"Sánchez-Thorin, J.C.; Fundacion Santa Fe de Bogota, Avenida 9 No. 117-20 (908), Santafé de Bogotá, Colombia",,"11158822",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035150790

Methods: The records of 115 patients with a diagnosis of non-traumatic orbital haemorrhage were reviewed with regard to clinical findings, investigations, management and outcome. Results: Associated orbital vascular malformations were present in 104 patients (90%). Thirteen (11%) had additional or other predisposing factors (childbirth, prolonged headstands, hypertension or coagulopathies). Six patients (5%) had no predisposing factor. Acute onset painful proptosis, associated with lid swelling or a mass, was the most common presentation. Visual acuity was reduced in 37 patients (32%) at presentation. Excluding eight patients (7%) who underwent surgery for optic nerve compression, spontaneous resolution of the haemorrhage was complete in 62%, partial in 27%, while 4% had no resolution. Final visual acuity was reduced in 23 patients (20%). Conclusion: The majority of bleeds are associated with some form of orbital vascular anomaly. Where no such anomaly can be demonstrated a search for an underlying systemic cause should be performed. Haemorrhages in the young were usually localized whereas those in older patients were diffuse. Orbital imaging, with a combination of computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging, was helpful in the assessment of these lesions. Most bleeds are venous and self-limiting. Surgical intervention was rarely necessary and should be confined to those with optic nerve compromise or a localized lesion which persists.","Arterio-venous malformation; Coagulopathy; Lymphangioma; Orbit; Orbital haemorrhage; Venous anomaly","adult; arteriovenous malformation; article; bleeding; blood clotting disorder; child; disease association; female; human; lymphangioma; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology; orbit; retrospective study; risk factor; vein malformation; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Arteriovenous Malformations; Child; Child, Preschool; Exophthalmos; Female; Great Britain; Humans; Incidence; Infant; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Middle Aged; Orbit; Retrobulbar Hemorrhage; Risk Factors; Tomography, X-Ray Computed; Veins; Visual Acuity",,"Sullivan, T.J.; Oculoplastic Clinic, Royal Brisbane Hospital, Herston Road, Herston, Brisbane, QLD 4029, Australia; email: tjs@gil.com.au",,"11345340",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033944922

Methods: Eighty-one patients received 6 mega units of natural interferon-α intramuscularly daily for 2 weeks and then 3 times a week for 22 weeks. The total dose of interferon-α administered was uniformly 478 mega units per patient. Two expert ophthalmologists prospectively examined the patients for retinal lesions before, during and after the therapy. Results: Retinopathy was not found in comparison groups or any of the patients before treatment. In total 34.6% (28/81) of the patients showed cotton-wool spots or minor retinal hemorrhage, or both lesions, during therapy, but these lesions were reversed during or after interferon therapy. The occurrence rates of cotton-wool spots alone, retinal hemorrhage alone and both lesions were 13.6% (11/81), 6.2% (5/81), and 14.8% (12/81), respectively. The appearance of retinopathy did not correlate with patients' background including viral loads and response to the therapy, but was more frequently found in older patients and patients with hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus; disappearance of retinopathy was more prolonged than in patients without these complications. Almost all the lesions appeared 2-4 months after the start of the therapy, and the severity of the lesions did not differ between patients with and without hypertension and/or diabetes mellitus. Conclusion: Although it is not clear if interferon-associated retinopathy occurs in a dose-dependent manner, the present study shows a standard pattern of the occurrence of retinopathy in patients with chronic hepatitis C receiving a uniform dosage of natural interferon-α.","Chronic hepatitis C; Cotton-wool spots; Diabetes mellitus; Hypertension; Natural interferon-α; Retinal hemorrhage","alpha interferon; vidarabine; vidarabine phosphate; xiao chai hu tang; adult; age; article; complication; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; disease severity; dose response; female; hepatitis C; human; hypertension; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology; prospective study; retina disease; retina hemorrhage; retinopathy; virus load; Age Distribution; Antiviral Agents; Diabetes Complications; Diabetes Mellitus; Dose-Response Relationship, Drug; Female; Hepatitis C, Chronic; Humans; Hypertension; Injections, Intramuscular; Interferon-alpha; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmoscopy; Prospective Studies; Retinal Diseases",,"Saito, H.; Department of Internal Medicine, School of Medicine, Keio University, 35 Shinanomachi, Shinjuku-ku, Tokyo 160-8582, Japan; email: hsaito@med.keio.ac.jp",,"11422782",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034961761

To assess whether the issuing of local guidelines for glaucoma detection including a protocol for the referral of suspects can improve the quality and accuracy of referrals from optometrists. Methods. Universally agreed guidelines, which included a protocol for referring glaucoma suspects; were circulated to all optometrists in the catchment area of a major teaching hospital ophthalmic unit. Data on 207 new patients referred to one glaucoma clinic were collected from GOS18 forms and hospital records covering two 12 month periods spanning the guideline dissemination. Referral accuracy was calculated and the reasons for protocol violations and referral of normal individuals were determined. Where possible, data were compared with a similar study relating to referrals made to the same clinic in 1988 and 1993. Results. The mean (SD) intraocular pressure (IOP) at which optometrists referred patients was 22.5 (6.6) in 1997 and 21.9 mmHg (6.6) in 1998/9, both significantly less than in 1988. A statistically significant upward trend with time was found in the number of patients referred with an assessment of cup/disc ratio and in those with details of a visual field assessment. The overall 'true positive diagnosis' was 40% (42/105) in 1997 and 32.3% (33/102) in 1998/9 after the guidelines (p = 0.32), both of which were significantly lower than the 1988 rate of 56% (34/75) (p = 0.03 and 0.003). Fifty per cent of false positive referrals in both 1997 and 1998/9 were associated with an assessment by the optometrist of the optic disc(s) that was at variance with the ophthalmologist's. False positive visual fields were associated with 22% and 35% of non-true positive referrals in 1997 and 1998/9. Protocol violations were observed in 48% of referrals after the guidelines had been disseminated. When the referral was both a false positive and the guideline protocol was not followed, 88% of violations were associated with IOP measurement in 1997 and 73% in 1998/9. The equivalent figures for visual field violations were 70% in 1997 and 76% in 1998/9. Normal individuals referred as suspects were significantly (p = 0.001) less likely to be referred on IOP grounds if their optometrist followed the referral protocol. Conclusion. Local dissemination of glaucoma screening guidelines with a protocol for referral did not appear to improve the diagnostic accuracy of optometrists in our area. Optometrists who follow the guidelines refer fewer normal individuals on IOP grounds, but false positive visual fields and optic disc interpretation difficulties remain a factor in such referrals. Additional strategies will be necessary to improve the quality and accuracy of referrals for suspect glaucoma by optometrists.","Glaucoma; Guidelines; Optometrists; Protocol; Screening","adult; aged; article; clinical practice; clinical protocol; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; female; glaucoma; health care quality; health center; human; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; male; medical record; ophthalmology; optic disk; optometry; patient referral; practice guideline; screening test; teaching hospital; visual field; visual system examination",,"Vernon, S.A.; Eye and ENT Centre, University Hospital, Department of Ophthalmology, Nottingham NG7 2UH, United Kingdom","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11767019",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034891613

Results: Myopia increased by an average of 1.46 D and was strongly correlated with a 0.56-mm increase in axial length. There was no contribution to the change in myopia from the change in central radius of the cornea. A significant (p < 0.01, one tail) correlation was found between Q and the progression of myopia.

Prescription analysis showed that 75 to 95% drugs were prescribed from essential drug list. The average number of drugs per prescription was 1.42 to 4.07. Percentage of antibiotics prescribed varied from 14.39% to 22.28%. The use of injections was from nil to 4.4%. Availability of drugs was however, not satisfactory. Though maximum drugs were prescribed from essential drug list, the results indicate that there is a considerable scope for improving prescribing habits according to rational drug use and to provide a feed back to hospital authority for making maximum number of drugs available to the patients.","Essential drug list; Prescribing pattern; Rational drug use","antibiotic agent; essential drug; generic drug; article; clinical practice; drug formulary; drug utilization; health care availability; hospital; India; injection; prescription; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Drug Utilization; Drugs, Generic; Hospitals, Special; India; Ophthalmology; Prescriptions, Drug",,"Biswas, N.R.; Dr. R.

METHODS: Patients with early to moderate glaucoma (n = 105) were consecutively enrolled to participate in a prospective observational study. In the first part of the present study, optic disk photographs obtained closest to patient’s entry date in the prospective study were classified in a masked fashion by three observers according to the pattern of optic disk damage into one of the following: (1) focal, (2) myopic, (3) senile sclerotic, (4) concentric cup enlargement, (5) normal appearance, or (6) miscellaneous (those disks that did not qualify for any of the other groups). The observers were also asked to assign a confidence score for each classification, ranging from 1 (low confidence) to 5 (highest confidence). The three observers reclassified the photographs after a minimal period of 2 months, in order to assess intraobserver agreement. In a second part of the study, one observer reviewed, in a masked fashion, all the optic disk photographs that had been taken during the routine follow-up of the 105 patients in order to evaluate whether the classification of disk pattern changed over time. RESULTS: Intraobserver agreement yielded kappa values (95% confidence interval [CI]) from 0.51 (CI, 0.40 to 0.62) to 0.85 (CI, 0.77 to 0.93) depending on the observer. Interobserver agreement kappa values between all three observers was 0.40 (CI, 0.35 to 0.46), but it improved if photographs classified with moderate or higher degrees of confidence were included (0.52 [CI, 0.44 to 0.60]). During a mean follow-up period of 8.2 ± 4.8 years, 41.6% of the eyes were always classified into the same group and 23.6% of the eyes were classified at least once into two or more of the four patterns of damage (groups 1 to 4) CONCLUSIONS: Intraobserver agreement on the pattern of optic disk damage was generally very good, with some variation among the observers. Interobserver agreement was reasonable and increased proportionally with the confidence in the classification. During long-term follow-up, the pattern of optic disk damage usually did not change. This type of classification can probably be used accurately in clinical practice. © 2001 Elsevier Science Inc.

After a brief intuitive introduction to the basis of fractal geometry, the clue is made about the correlation between Df and the complexity or the irregularity of a structure. However, fractal analysis must be applied with certain caution in natural objects such as bio-medical ones. The cardio-vascular system remains one of the most important fields of application of these kinds of approach. Spectral analysis of the R-R interval, morphology of the distal coronary arteries constitute two examples. Other very interesting applications are founded in bacteriology, medical imaging or ophthalmology. In our institution, we apply fractal analysis in order to quantitate angiogenesis and other vascular processes.

A right optic disk anomaly was present that was most compatible with an MGDA accompanied by an inferior choroidal coloboma. Because of the association of such disc malformations with moyamoya disease, the patient underwent cerebral MRI and MRA that showed narrowing of both internal carotid arteries, a finding consistent with early-stage moyamoya disease.

Relatively little empirical research has addressed physicians' responses to fee changes under the Medicare Fee Schedule. OBJECTIVES. We analyzed Medicare claims data for ophthalmologists and orthopedic surgeons for the years 1991 through 1994 to evaluate the relative importance of profit-maximizing and target-income theories in determining physicians' supply responses to specific Medicare fee reductions. RESEARCH DESIGN. This study was designed to estimate the impact of fee reductions for cataract extractions and major joint repair/replacement procedures through pooled cross-section time series data. RESULTS. The supply function for cataract extractions has both strong own-price and cross-price effects, as well as a highly significant negative income effect. Yet, the magnitude of the income effect is small; thus, the substitution effect dominates the income effect. Similarly, in the supply functions for joint procedures, the own price has the expected positive sign, implying that as the fee declines, orthopedic surgeons will perform fewer joint surgeries. However, the cross-price variable has the correct sign only if treated as exogenous, and the variables measuring the income effect have the wrong sign, although their magnitude is small. CONCLUSIONS. These results suggest that the Medicare Fee Schedule does have the potential to influence physicians' supply decisions, but these effects may vary by specialty and service.","Physician fee reductions; Supply response","adult; aged; arthroplasty; article; cataract extraction; clinical practice; economics; fee; health care delivery; human; income; medical fee; medicare; middle aged; ophthalmology; orthopedics; regression analysis; reimbursement; statistical model; United States; utilization review; Adult; Aged; Arthroplasty, Replacement; Cataract Extraction; Fee Schedules; Fees, Medical; Health Services Accessibility; Humans; Income; Insurance, Health, Reimbursement; Medicare; Middle Aged; Models, Econometric; Ophthalmology; Orthopedics; Physician's Practice Patterns; Regression Analysis; United States",,"Mitchell, J.M.; Georgetown Public Policy Institute, 3600 N St, NW Ste 200, Washington, DC 20007, United States; email: mitchejm@gunet.georgetown.edu","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11021676",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034293253

In the most extensively studied Norwegian family, the Mohr-Tranebjærg syndrome was reported to be caused by a one-basepair deletion (151delT) in the deafness/dystonia peptide (DDP) gene at Xq22. This gene has been renamed TIMM8a. We identified a stop mutation (E24X) in the TIMM8a gene segregating with the disease in the original Danish family with the Jensen syndrome, which confirms that the two disorders are allelic conditions. We also report abnormal VEP examinations and neuropathological abnormalities in affected males from the two unrelated families with different mutations. The findings included neuronal cell loss in the optic nerve, retina, striate cortex, basal ganglia, and dorsal roots of the spinal cord. The demonstration of mitochondrial abnormalities in skeletal muscle biopsies in some patients is compatible with the suggestion from recent research that the TIMM8a protein is the human counterpart of an intermembrane mitochondrial transport protein, Tim8p, recently characterized in yeast. The clinical and neuropathological abnormalities associated with mutations in the TIMM8a gene support that this X-linked deafness-dystonia-optic neuropathy syndrome is an example of progressive neurodegeneration due to mutations in a nuclear gene necessary for some, yet unknown mitochondrial transport function. We recommend sequencing the TIMM8a gene, thorough ophthalmological examination, and measuring visual evoked potentials in clinically suspected male patients with either progressive hearing impairment, dystonia, or visual disability in order to establish an early diagnosis and provide appropriate genetic counselling.","Dystonia; Hearing impairment; Mitochondrial dysfunction; Optic neuropathy; Progressive neuronal cell degeneration; TIMM8a; X-linked inheritance","carrier protein; article; basal ganglion; case report; cell death; chromosome Xq; controlled study; dementia; disease association; dystonia; evoked visual response; gene; gene deletion; gene mutation; genetic counseling; hearing impairment; human; human tissue; jensen syndrome; male; mental disease; mitochondrion; mohr tranebjaerg syndrome; muscle biopsy; nerve cell; nerve degeneration; neuropathology; ophthalmology; optic nerve; optic nerve disease; priority journal; retina; skeletal muscle; spinal cord; striate cortex; syndrome; TIMM8a gene; visual cortex; X chromosome recessive inheritance; yeast; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Cell Death; Child; Deafness; DNA Mutational Analysis; Dystonia; Electron Transport Complex IV; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Genes, Recessive; Humans; Immunoenzyme Techniques; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Middle Aged; Mitochondrial Diseases; Mutation; Neurons; Optic Nerve Diseases; Pedigree; Phosphopyruvate Hydratase; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Proteins; Syndrome; Visual Cortex; X Chromosome","Norges ForskningsrÃ¥d: 114575/320","Tranebjærg, L.; Department of Audiology, H:S Bispebjerg Hospital, DK-2400 Copenhagen, Denmark; email: lisbetht@fagmed.uit.no",,"11803487",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-17944399388

Materials and Methods A retrospective chart review of all patients given a diagnosis code of head trauma in the neuro-ophthalmology unit at Emory University between 1991 and 1999. Results A total of 326 consecutive patients were reviewed (203 [63%] men and 123 [37.0%] women). Age ranged from 2 to 86 years, with a mean of 30 years. Motor vehicle accident was the most common cause of head trauma, occurring in 195 (59.8%) patients. An abnormal neuro-ophthalmic examination was noted in 185 of 326 patients (56.7%). Loss of consciousness was not associated with any outcome, but the presence of a neuroimaging abnormality, particularly intracranial hemorrhage, was significantly associated with specific neuro-ophthalmic deficits. Conclusions Head trauma causes a number of neuro-ophthalmic manifestations. The afferent and efferent pathways are vulnerable to traumatic injury, although the efferent system is more commonly affected.

Previous studies have estimated observer variability among experts in the assessment of optic disc cupping, but there has been a paucity of information on observer variability amongst optometrists. This paper describes a study to investigate intra- and inter-observer variability for a range of disc features, as graded by both ophthalmologists and optometrists. Five observers (three optometrists and two ophthalmologists) graded 48 stereo-pairs of optic disc photographs from 48 patients on two separate occasions. Each observer graded the following features: vertical and horizontal C/D ratios, narrowest rim width, the presence/absence of a disc haemorrhage, focal pallor of the neuroretinal rim, peri-papillary atrophy, the steepness of the cup-edge and the presence/absence of the cribriform sign. The average intra- and inter-observer standard deviation (SD) of differences are, respectively, 0.11 and 0.19 for the vertical C/D ratios and 0.10 and 0.18 for the horizontal C/D ratios. For the vertical C/D ratio the average weighted kappa (κ(w)) is 0.79 within observers and 0.46 between observers. Percentage agreements for the presence/absence of a disc haemorrhage range from 96 to 100% (average κ=0.92) within observers and from 90 to 98% (average κ=0.77) between observers. For other disc features, average κ(w) values range from 0.67 to 0.71 within observers and from 0.23 to 0.46 between observers. Intra-and inter-observer comparisons (within and between different professionals) across all disc features are comparable for the optometrists and ophthalmologists, thus demonstrating that optometrists can make valid assessments of disc features. The implications for shared care are discussed.

Method: 283 consecutive patients were examined using digital colour and red-free photography (Topcon Imagenet System 1.53) and 35 mm slides (Topcon TRC-50 VT fundus camera, Kodachrome 64 colour film). The images were graded by the worst eye according to the Wisconsin classification by an ophthalmologist and ophthalmic nurse independently. Results: There was exact agreement between grades obtained from the colour slides and the digital colour images in 82% (weighted kappa 0.88: 95% CI 0.80-0.96), and in 85% when redfree images were used as an adjunct to the digital colour images. There was a tendency towards undergrading of the digital colour images and overgrading of the digital redfree images, compared with the colour slides. Inter- and intragrader agreement (weighted kappa) varied between 0.77 and 0.84 for digital photography and between 0.88 and 0.90 for colour slides. Conclusion: Good to excellent agreement was found between the grading of colour slides and digital colour images, the latter, however, associated with a slightly lower reliability.

Design: Prospective study of patients and postal questionnaire to healthcare professionals. Subjects: 50 patients with 6/9 vision and 50 with 6/12 vision and 100 general practitioners, 100 optometrists or opticians, and 100 ophthalmologists. Setting: Ophthalmology outpatient clinics in Sheffield. Main outcome measures: Ability to read a number plate at 20.5 m and health professionals' advice about driving on the basis of visual acuity. Results: 26% of patients with 6/9 vision failed the number plate test, and 34% with 6/12 vision passed it.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - We designed a 2-year program to improve the effectiveness of primary care providers to administer diabetes care. The program was conducted by the largest Israeli health maintenance organization, which insures 60% of the population. Interventions included continuing medical education and establishing guidelines and diabetes registers in every clinic. A retrospective cohort study was conducted from 1995 to 1997 to evaluate the project's effect on the care of diabetic patients. One patient was randomly chosen for review from each of the physicians' updated diabetes registers. The same indicators and variables were collected for each year. RESULTS - The response rate was 72.7%. Nationwide, 876 physicians participated in the review. From 1995 to 1997, there was a statistically significant improvement in the prevalence of performing all of the parameters for monitoring the primary care of diabetic patients. The process parameters showed a considerable improvement: the prevalence of recording weight increased from 35% of the diabetic patients in 1995 to 60% in 1997; the prevalence of conducting foot inspections increased from 40 to 63%; the prevalence of conducting fundus examinations increased from 38.5 to 68.3%; and the prevalence of measuring HbA(1c) values increased from 30.6 to 69.9%. As a result, metabolic control significantly improved: the percentage of diabetic patients with HbA(1c) concentration >9% decreased from 33.2% in 1995 to 22.5% in 1997; the percentage of diabetic patients with HbA(1c) concentration <7.4% increased from 45.1 to 50.5%.

We studied risk factors for cortical lens opacification only, the most common as well as the earliest age related change we observe in the lens. Methods: 1,045 persons, 583 females and 462 males, 50 years and older, underwent a detailed eye examination and answered a questionnaire. Participants with cortical lens opacification grade I, totalling 374 persons, were assigned to case-control study I, and to case-control study II those with cortical lens opacification grades II and III, totalling 82 subjects. 378 age and sex matched persons served as controls. Results: Those who spent more than 4 hours/day outside on weekdays, in their 20's-30's and 40's-50's respectively, were found to have increased risk of moderate to severe cortical lens opacification. Thus the relative risk for grades II & III, was 2.80 (95% CI 1.01-7.80) and 2.91 (95% CI 1.13-9.62) respectively. Ageing and systemic cortical steroids use were also found to be risk factors.

In the first phase, starting in 1999, 28 pilot sites were established in six provinces. The initial applications were teleradiology, tele-ultrasound for antenatal services, telepathology and tele-ophthalmology. Telemedicine equipment was connected by ISDN at 256 kbit/s. From January to September 2000, 2663 radiographic studies were performed at the three Northwest Province teleradiology transmission sites, of which 264 studies (10%) were selected for specialist radiologist reporting by teleradiology. From June to August 2000, nine antenatal care tele-ultrasound consultations were performed in the Northern Cape Province and four transfers were avoided through the use of telemedicine. One area of concern is the relatively low usage of the telemedicine system, which raises questions about its cost-effectiveness. The experience of telemedicine in South Africa confirmed, as others have found, that common problems relate to the technical and organizational challenges of introducing telemedicine.",,"article; consultation; echography; female; health care planning; health care quality; human; ophthalmology; organization and management; pathology; pregnancy; public health; public health service; South Africa; standard; telecommunication; Female; Health Plan Implementation; Human; National Health Programs; Ophthalmology; Pregnancy; Program Evaluation; Public Health Administration; Remote Consultation; South Africa; Telepathology; Teleradiology; Ultrasonography, Prenatal",,"Gulube, S.M.; Telemedicine Research Centre, Medical Research Council, Private Bag X 385, Pretoria 0001, South Africa; email: sam.gulube@mrc.ac.za","Royal Society of Medicine Press Ltd","11747657",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035226128

Much less is known about such differences associated with different forms of diabetes. Methods: People with types 1 and 2 diabetes were identified from claims of a commercial insurer with an enrollment of 828 208. Age- and sex-adjusted rates and observed-to-expected ratios for health care services use, costs, and relative value units were compared for individuals with diabetes and the total plan population. Results: We identified 13 563 individuals with diabetes (including 4349 with type 1 and 8810 with type 2 diabetes). The diabetic population was 1.6% of the total population, but had 9.4% of costs. Individuals with both types of diabetes had higher rates for use of inpatient, outpatient, and professional services. Compared with the total population, inpatient rates for the total diabetic population (for those with type 1 diabetes), were 4.9 (8.3) times higher for established complications of diabetes such as acute myocardial infarction, 9.8 (22.) times higher for heart failure, 5.6 (8.3) times higher or coronary artery bypass, and 5.1 (8.9) times higher for cardiac catheterization (P<.001 for all). The following relative value unit ratios for physician services were ubstantially higher for the total diabetic population (for those with type 1 diabetes): 13.2 (27.9) times higher for endocrinologists, 6.3 (12.9) for ophthalmologists and 9.4 (27.8) for nephrologists. Conclusions: Use, costs, and intensity of resources used were substantially higher for individuals with diabetes, and markedly higher for the population with type 1 diabetes.

The efficacy of optic nerve decompression in patients with osteopetrosis is still controversial. The purpose of this study is to report that visual deterioration in osteopetrosis can be completely reversed by early optic nerve decompression. An 8-year-old female patient with osteopetrosis was found to have reduced visual acuity on routine ophthalmologic examination. Extensive optic nerve decompression was performed. It not only included unroofing the optic canal, but also drilling away bone on both sidewalls of the optic nerve. Both optic nerves were decompressed during the same surgical procedure. Progressive loss of vision associated with osteopetrosis can be prevented by optic nerve decompression in the early stage of visual deterioration. When managing patients with osteopetrosis, the importance of careful and regular assessment of visual function should be stressed. Copyright © 2001 S.

Iris indocyanine green angiography (IICGA) can visualize more precisely details of the iris vascular pattern, especially as regards hypoperfusion and capillary dilatations. The aim of the present study is to describe the angiographic features of PXS on IFA and IICGA, comparing eyes affected with those not affected by capsular glaucoma. Methods: In a prospective study 42 consecutive patients affected by PXS underwent a complete ophthalmologic examination including IFA and IICGA. Thirty-two eyes were affected by capsular glaucoma. IICGA was performed using IMAGEnet System H1024. Results: IFA can easily detect the microneovascularisation, whereas IICGA allows a better recognition of iris hypoperfusion and anastomotic vessels, and it can reveal iris pigment epithelium defects. While the degree of hypoperfusion was similar in the two subgroups, eyes affected by capsular glaucoma more frequently showed signs of both microneovascularisation (marked stromal tufts and marked plexi), and of anastomotic vessels (peripheral loop, lesser circle and oblique vessels), with statistically significant difference. A clear correlation between hypoperfusion, microneovascularisation, and anastomotic vessels as regards site and extent was not noticed. Conclusions: A different angiographic pattern can be detected in PXS eyes with capsular glaucoma in comparison with eyes without it. Further studies are needed to correlate angiographic features revealed by IFA and IICGA, with clinical features.","Iris fluorescein angiography; Iris indocyanine green angiography; Pseudoexfoliation syndrome","indocyanine green; adult; aged; article; clinical trial; female; fluorescence angiography; glaucoma; human; indocyanine green angiography; intermethod comparison; iris blood vessel; major clinical study; male; neovascularization (pathology); ophthalmology; perfusion; pigment epithelium; priority journal; prospective study; pseudoexfoliation; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Capillary Permeability; Diagnosis, Differential; Exfoliation Syndrome; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Glaucoma, Neovascular; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Iris; Male; Middle Aged; Prospective Studies",,"Battaglia Parodi, M.; Eye Clinic, University of Trieste, C/o Ospedale Maggiore, 34129 Trieste, Italy",,"10990047",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033852614

This study examined how varying stimulus parameters affects the magnitude of horizontal fixation disparity and the precision of nonius alignment in normal observers. Methods: Targets were bright vertical lines presented for 150 ms on an oscilloscope and viewed in the dark from 3.95 m through a mirror haploscope. The fusion stimulus was either central, peripheral, or central-plus-peripheral. Fixation disparity was measured for nonius lines with a fixed vertical separation and variable lengths, using the method of constant stimuli. In a second experiment, fixation disparity was assessed for vergence demands of 6Δ base-in to 12Δ base-out using nonius lines of fixed length and variable vertical separations. For comparison, binocular Vernier thresholds and constant errors were also assessed. Results: Mean Values of fixation disparity are invariant with the length and separation of the nonius lines and proximity to the fusion lock, over the range of values tested. When measured with a central fusion lock, the precision of binocular nonius alignment (vergence variability) worsens if the separation between the nonius lines increases beyond approximately 20 min arc. Vergence variability is larger with a peripheral fusion lock for small nonius-line separations and approximately the same as with the central lock for large line separations. Fixation disparity and precision were smallest with a central-plus-peripheral fusion-lock combination. Similar effects of line length and separation were found for binocular Vernier. Conclusions: The finding of invariance of fixation disparity with line length for nonius targets < 1°extends those of earlier findings for larger targets. Because the precision of binocular nonius alignment is poorer for large nonius-line separations or with a peripheral fusion lock, fixation disparity should be most repeatable when measured with a central fusion lock and nonius lines separated by 20 min arc or less. However, a peripheral fusion lock and small nonius-line separation may provide the most effective diagnostic combination for fixation disparity.Clinical devices for fixation disparity vary in the size and position of the nonius test-lines and in the location of the binocular fusion lock.

Design: Cross-sectional study and noncomparative case series. Participants: Thirty-one thousand fifty-three preschool children. Methods: Analysis of (1) referral rate and unreadable photograph rate for all children screened, (2) examination results and treatment plan for all children referred for suspected astigmatism, and (3) examination results and treatment for all referred children aged less than 1 year. Main Outcome Measures: Referral rate, unreadable photograph rate, predictive value positive, treatment plan. Results: The referral rate dropped from 7.8% for children 6 to 11 months to 5.3% for all other ages. The unreadable photograph rate declined exponentially from 12.1% for children aged 6- to 11-months to 1.1% for children aged 4 years. The predictive value positive of a photoscreen referral for all children in the 6- to 11 -month age group was 30%, and only 12 of the 94 referred children were treated. The predictive value positive for children less than 1 year of age referred with suspected astigmatism was even lower (25%), and only one child in this age group was treated. The predictive value positive increased with age, and a higher percentage of older children were treated. For children at least 3 years old referred for suspected astigmatism, the predictive value positive was 67% when the examination was performed by a pediatric ophthalmologist. Strabismus, anisometropia, and high hypermetropia were diagnosed in such patients age 2 and older but never in younger children. Conclusions: Children less than 1 year of age have a much lower pass rate from photoscreening than do older children because of a higher referral rate and higher unreadable rate in this age group. When these children are examined, significant pathosis is usually absent, and intervention is rarely initiated. Most children age 2 and older who are referred for suspected astigmatism have a high likelihood of significant pathosis. It is probably unnecessary to examine children less than age 2 when their photoscreening suggests only astigmatism; conversely, referrals should still be provided for these children when their screening suggests other potentially amblyogenic factors. © 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,"adolescent; adult; age; aged; article; astigmatism; child; diagnostic test; diagnostic value; human; infant; major clinical study; medical specialist; ophthalmology; patient referral; photography; prediction; priority journal; reading; screening; strabismus; validation process; visual acuity; Age Factors; Amblyopia; Astigmatism; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; False Positive Reactions; Humans; Infant; Photography; Predictive Value of Tests; Referral and Consultation; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Vision Screening",,"Donahue, S.P.; Department of Ophthalmology, Vanderbilt Univ.

Methods: A two-page self-administered questionnaire was mailed to all Australian ophthalmologists and a random sample of 500 Australian optometrists prior to and 1 year after release of the National Health and Medical Research Council of Australia (NHMRC) clinical practice guidelines for the management of diabetic retinopathy. The questionnaires elicited information about current practice related to the management of patients with diabetic retinopathy. Results: Of the 464 contactable ophthalmologists who responded to the baseline survey, 374 (80.6% response) completed the follow-up survey. The response rate for the contactable optometrists was 80.1% (310 of 384). There were almost no significant changes in management practices from baseline to follow up. For example, the percentage of ophthalmologists who reported that they were often or almost always confident in detecting moderate retinal thickening near the macula remained nearly identical from baseline to follow up (80.2% vs 79.1%). The rate was also similar from baseline to follow up for optometrists (31.1% vs 28.8%). The one area in which ophthalmologists reported significant changes in management towards agreement with the NHMRC guidelines was use of angiography; they were less likely to manage their patients this way (20.4% vs 14.2% with laser and 48.9% vs 38.4% without laser for increasing level of severity in clinical signs; both P < 0.05). Conclusions: The NHMRC guidelines for diabetic retinopathy have been successfully distributed to ophthalmologists and optometrists in Australia. However, the mere provision of the guidelines has had little impact on management practices. It will be important to determine if ongoing dissemination and implementation strategies not only increase awareness of health-care practitioners to the guidelines, but also change behaviours.","Diabetic retinopathy; Evaluation studies; Health services research; Physician's practice patterns; Practice guidelines","article; Australia; awareness; behavior; clinical practice; clinical protocol; diabetic retinopathy; disease severity; follow up; health practitioner; human; laser; medical assessment; ophthalmology; optometry; patient referral; physician attitude; practice guideline; questionnaire; retina angiography; retina macula lutea",,"McCarty, C.A.; Centre for Eye Research Australia, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, 32 Gisborne Street, East Melbourne, Vic. 3002, Australia; email: cathy@cera.unimelb.edu.au","Blackwell Publishing","11341446",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035035405

Permanent stenosis of lacrimal puncta and canaliculi is rare. This report highlights this uncommon complication of 5-fluorouracil therapy. Methods: Report of two cases and review of literature. Results: Severe stenosis of puncta and canaliculi may be associated with prolonged systemic 5-fluorouracil therapy. Conclusion: It is important for both the oncologist and ophthalmologist to be aware of the potential ocular toxicity of 5-fluorouracil. Surgical management to relieve the epiphora is often challenging, and early intervention may be beneficial.","5-Fluorouracil (5-FU); Canalicular stenosis; Cancer chemotherapy; Drug side effects; Epiphora; Ocular toxicity","fluorouracil; adult; aged; article; cancer; case report; epiphora; female; human; lacrimal duct; lacrimal duct occlusion; lacrimation; male; oncology; ophthalmology; priority journal; Aged; Carcinoma; Colectomy; Colonic Neoplasms; Dacryocystorhinostomy; Female; Fluorouracil; Humans; Immunosuppressive Agents; Lacrimal Duct Obstruction; Male; Middle Aged",,"Prasad, S.; The University of Sheffield, Floor 'O', Royal Hallamshire Hospital, Glossop Road, Sheffield S10 2JF, United Kingdom; email: S.Prasad@Sheffield.ac.uk",,"10726804",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033975895

Lens was sacrificed in all but one eye. Surgery involved an attempt to clear all preretinal tissue and open the peripheral trough all round. In most instances bimanual surgery under viscoelastic was performed. Results: At last follow up, anatomical success (defined as attached posterior pole) was achieved in 22.5% cases. Significant postoperative problems included reproliferation and secondary glaucoma. Only two infants obtained mobile vision. Conclusion: Late identification of disease, lack of prior treatment such as laser or cryo, and higher incidence of narrow-narrow funnel configuration were responsible for the poor surgical results noted in this series. The poor surgical and functional results reemphasise the need for prompt screening and management of infants at risk.","Learning curve; Retinal detachment; Retinopathy of prematurity; Vitrectomy","article; classification; clinical competence; comparative study; education; female; human; infant; lens; male; methodology; newborn; ophthalmology; reoperation; retrolental fibroplasia; retrospective study; treatment outcome; vitrectomy; Clinical Competence; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lens, Crystalline; Male; Ophthalmology; Reoperation; Retinopathy of Prematurity; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Vitrectomy",,"Gopal, L.; Med. and Vision Research Foundation, 18 College Road, Chennai-600 006, India; email: MDSAAA35@giasmd01.vsnl.net.in",,"11116504",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034198247

Respondents: Questionnaires were sent to 930 ophthalmologist members of the Japanese Society of Cataract and Refractive Surgery. Data received from 457 (49.1%) of the recipients were cross-analyzed and compared with those from the previous surveys. Results: In cataract surgery, 17% of respondents were doing 51 or more cases per month, 94% preferred phacoemulsification, 58% employed the self-sealing wound closure technique, and 26% used topical anesthesia for phacoemulsification. In refractive surgery, excimer laser surgery and astigmatic keratotomy attracted notably high interest, while less attention was directed toward radial keratotomy and intrastromal corneal ring. Laser in situ keratomileusis, photorefractive keratectomy, phakic intraocular lens, intrastromal corneal ring, and radial keratotomy were judged to be useful refractive surgical procedures by 69.0%, 40.0%, 24.6%, 14.2%, and 8.0% of the respondents, respectively. Conclusion: There are trends toward more surgical procedures performed by a surgeon, shorter period of hospitalization, and increasing preference for small incision cataract surgery. Refractive surgery is not yet widely performed, but laser in situ keratomileusis is viewed as the most promising procedure.

Ocular involvement may occur in up to 32% of persons afflicted by sarcoid. The neuro-ophthalmic manifestations of sarcoid, in particular, are varied and may affect any portion of the visual system, including neural structures. Diagnosis is often difficult due to the fact that the clinical presentation can mimic other disorders, such as Multiple Sclerosis, and therefore a systematic approach to testing must be used once the diagnosis has been considered. The importance of diagnosing neuro-ophthalmic sarcoid lies in the fact that it is a treatable disease. The mainstay of treatment is corticosteroids although other immunosuppressive agents may be used. The long-term prognosis of neuro-ophthalmic sarcoid has not been studied in large patient populations, but the data that is available suggests that remission may occur in up to 47%.","Neuro-ophthalmology; Optic neuropathy; Sarcoidosis","article; eye disease; human; iridocyclitis; multiple organ failure; multiple sclerosis; neuroophthalmology; optic nerve; priority journal; prognosis; sarcoidosis; Eye Diseases; Humans; Sarcoidosis; Vision Disorders",,"Digre, K.; Department of Ophthalmology, John Moran Eye Center, University of Utah, 50 North Medical Drive, Salt Lake City, UT 84132, United States",,"10874782",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033933879

One such instrument, the National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ), was developed to assess vision-related quality of life with respect to emotional well-being and social function as well as difficulty with tasks and symptoms. We administered the NEI-VFQ to 218 subjects free of eye disease to see if the survey was sensitive enough to detect differences in three modes of refractive error correction: Spectacles, soft contact lenses, and rigid contact lenses. Methods: Surveys were administered to 117 rigid contact lens wearers, 51 spectacle wearers, and 50 soft contact lens wearers. Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance was conducted to determine significant differences in each of the subscales. Results: The Peripheral Vision subscale score (mean ± SD) was 92.6 ± 15.2 for the spectacle wearers, 100.0 ± 0.0 for the soft contact lens wearers, and 98.3 ± 7.1 for the rigid gas-permeable contact lens wearers; the spectacle wearers' Peripheral Vision score was significantly lower than the other two groups (Wilcoxon rank sum, p < 0.003 for both). The spectacle wearers (96.6 ± 9.2) also had a significantly lower Dependency subscale score than the rigid contact lens group (99.7 ± 1.5) (Wilcoxon rank sum, p = 0.001). There were no significant differences between the three groups detected in the mean of any of the other subscale scores. At least 50% of the subjects reported the maximum score for 6 of the 11 subscales. Given our sample size, we have 100% power to detect a difference of 10 points with a SD of 10 at the α = 0.05 level. Conclusion: The NEI-VFQ is not appropriate for detecting significant differences in vision-related quality of life among spectacle, soft contact lens, and rigid gas-permeable contact lens wearers, primarily due to maximum ratings by many of the subjects.The National Eye Institute Visual Function Questionnaire (NEI-VFQ) was administered to 218 subjects free of eye disease to see if the survey was sensitive enough to detect differences in three modes of refractive error correction: spectacles, soft contact lenses, and rigid contact lenses.

Methods: The series comprised 9 subjects with facial haemangiomas of rapid growth within the first few months of life. All haemangiomas had relation to an eyelid and affected the visual access to the eye. At least three tumours were also intraorbital, and in one case the glottis was affected. Interferon-alfa was given subcutaneously in daily doses of 3 mio units/m2. Ophthalmic follow-up including ultrasound evaluation was done, initially with intervals of 4-8 weeks. Results: Interferon-alfa was given over 9-41 weeks (median duration 22 weeks) in cumulated doses of 63-287 million units. Progression was arrested in all and with a subsequent tumour regression considered accelerated as judged from earlier clinical giant haemangioma experience. A control series was not possible. One patient had systemic prednisone added over some weeks. Two infants reacted with a flu-like malaise. A premature infant developed a slight spastic diplegia. Conclusions: In the 9 infants with growing ophthalmic haemangiomas we recorded a good response to systemic Interferon-alfa administered as daily doses by subcutaneous injection. In general the treatment appeared well tolerated. During clinical follow-up diagnostic ultrasound evaluation (the depth dimension) proved helpful; in particular there was a sparing effect on CT and MRI scans which require general anaesthesia.","Amblyopia; Eye at risk; Haemangiomas of the face; Induced refractive change; Infancy; Interferon alfa; Ultrasound imaging","prednisone; recombinant alpha2b interferon; article; cell proliferation; clinical article; clinical trial; computer assisted tomography; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; dose response; drug efficacy; drug tolerability; echography; endothelium; evaluation; eyelid; female; flu like syndrome; follow up; general anesthesia; glottis; hemangioma; human; infant; malaise; male; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ophthalmology; orbit; paralysis; priority journal; tumor growth; tumor localization; tumor regression; Antineoplastic Agents; Drug Therapy, Combination; Eyelid Neoplasms; Facial Neoplasms; Female; Hemangioma, Capillary; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Injections, Subcutaneous; Interferon-alpha; Male; Orbital Neoplasms; Prednisone; Treatment Outcome",,"Fledelius, H.C.; University Eye Department E 2061, Rigshospitalet, DK 2100 Copenhagen Ø, Denmark",,"11453856",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034922453

A pilot study was designed to assess the feasibility of stereoscopic digital imaging to identify levels of diabetic retinopathy via teleophthalmology. Diabetic patients were assessed for diabetic retinopathy by seven field stereoscopic digital imaging through a dilated pupil. Images were transferred by satellite to a tertiary eye center for review by a retinal specialist. Images were viewed stereoscopically on a video monitor, with grading of all images using a modified Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) classification. Patients found to have treatable diabetic retinopathy were transferred to a tertiary eye center for assessment and treatment by a retinal specialist. One hundred patients (199 eyes) had stereoscopic digital imaging of the retina. Microaneurysms were identified in 70 eyes, hard exudates in 31 eyes. Two eyes were identified with neovascularization of the disc (NVD) and 15 eyes with clinically significant macular edema (CSME). All eyes identified by stereoscopic digital imaging with treatable disease were confirmed by clinical examination with contact lens biomicroscopy.

Methods - 112 consecutive new patients presenting to a glaucoma service had dilated optic disc photography performed using a new digital stereo camera (Discam, Marcher Enterprises Ltd, Hereford). The images were analysed by two masked observers using a stereo viewer and computer simulated stereopsis. Vertical and horizontal cup:disc ratios (CDR), cup area:disc area, and cup circumference:disc circumference were computed. Intraobserver and interobserver repeatability analyses were performed. Intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC) and 95% tolerance for change (TC) were computed. Results - 220 optic discs were photographed, of which 196 were suitable for analysis (10 were of poor image quality and 14 had anomalous discs). Mean age of patients was 65 years, 60 were male and 48 female. For intraobserver measurements of: horizontal CDR, ICC = 0.94, TC = 0.11 (15% of range); vertical CDR, ICC = 0.92, TC = 0.14 (16% of range); cup area:disc area, ICC = 0.95, TC = 0.10 (13% of range), and cup circumference:disc circumference, ICC = 0.95, TC = 0.09 (14% of range). For interobserver measurements of: horizontal CDR, ICC = 0.89, TC = 0.14 (19% of range); vertical CDR, ICC = 0.90, TC = 0.14 (16% of range); cup area:disc area, ICC = 0.92, TC = 0.13 (16% of range), and cup circumference:disc circumference, ICC = 0.90, TC = 0.12 (17% of range). Systematic bias between observers was within acceptable limits. Conclusions - Digital stereo disc photography and analysis provide repeatable measures of optic disc variables.

Methods: Thirty-nine patients were found with normal Va of 20/20 (logMAT 0) or better 8 to 166 months (mean ± SD, 58.8 ± 41.2) after active CSC. Color vision was examined with the Standard Pseudoisochromatic Plates part 2, Farnsworth-munsell 100 hue test, and Color Vision Meter 712 anomaloscope. Results: Of the CSC eyes, 26 (67%) had a color vision defect, most of them in the blue area. There was no correlation between the time since the active disease and the results on the color vision tests. Of the contralateral eyes, 19 (49%) also had a color vision defect. Conclusion: In many patients some degree of color vision defect remains after CSC even if the VA has recovered to normal. The contralateral eye can also have a color vision defect. This has not been previously reported and might be due to earlier subclinical CSC.","Central serous chorioretinopathy; Color vision; Color vision tests; Follow-up study","adult; aged; article; central serous retinopathy; clinical feature; color vision defect; color vision test; correlation function; female; follow up; human; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology",,"Mäntyjärvi, M.I.; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Kuopio, P.O.

It has undoubtedly been experienced for millennia, but its clinical significance has been appreciated only in modern times. The Norwegian painter Edvard Munch recognized scotomas and metamorphopsia after suffering an intraocular hemorrhage in his 60th year. Drawings made during this illness show his changing perceptions, and also his attempts to document them with a grid of lines. The Scottish philosopher Thomas Reid may have been the first to write about metamorphopsia. He described distortion of his vision in 1764, after an episode of sungazing, and recognized that the problem was probably of retinal origin. Lines or grids to document metamorphopsia have appeared in ophthalmology textbooks for more than 100 years, but testing for macular degeneration did not become routine until the dissemination of Amsler's grids in the middle of the 20th century. This is in large measure a result of developments in ophthalmology that made therapy for macular disease possible.

Design: A hospital-based retrospective, cross-sectional study. Participants: One thousand four hundred seventy-two patients admitted to the University of California Los Angeles Medical Center. Methods: We reviewed the inpatient medical records, discharge summaries, and Ophthalmology Consultation Service notes of every patient evaluated by the Service from July 1990 through January 1997. Main Outcome Measures: We recorded demographic information, hospitalization information, and eye examination information, including reason for consultation, type of consultation (screening examination, new eye problem, or preexisting eye problem), as well as primary and secondary ophthalmologic diagnoses. Results: Internal medicine services requested 39.7% of consultations, surgery services 20.9%, and trauma services 13.5%. There were 92 different reasons why consultations were requested. The most common reason was decreased vision. Eye problems that developed either on the day of admission or some time during hospitalization accounted for 39.6% of consultations, preexisting eye problems accounted for 31.6%, and screening examinations for the remaining 28.7%. We recorded 166 unique primary ophthalmologic diagnoses and 130 unique secondary ophthalmologic diagnoses. The top five common primary ophthalmologic diagnoses were refractive error (88 patients), fungal endophthalmitis ruled out (80 patients), conjunctivitis (56 patients), diabetic retinopathy (52 patients), and corneal abrasion (52 patients). Refractive error was the most common secondary ophthalmologic diagnosis (201 patients). Inpatient diagnostic or surgical procedures were performed 7911 times. There were 947 unique primary and 1391 unique secondary hospital discharge diagnoses. The most common primary discharge diagnosis, human immunodeficiency virus infection, accounted for only 1.6% of all hospitalizations, indicating a considerable diversity of systemic disease in the study population. Conclusions: This study profiled the typical patients and eye problems an ophthalmologist may expect to encounter when inpatient consultation is requested. The information may be useful for the planning and management of consultation services in residency training programs. © 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,"article; conjunctivitis; consultation; cornea injury; diabetic retinopathy; endophthalmitis; female; health service; hospital patient; hospital service; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; refraction error; teaching hospital; visual impairment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Eye Diseases; Female; Hospitals, University; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Inpatients; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Referral and Consultation; Retrospective Studies",,"Miller, K.M.; Jules Stein Eye Institute, University of California Los Angeles, 100 Stein Plaza, Los Angeles, CA 90095-7002, United States; email: miller@jsei.ucla.edu",,"11470711",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034902662

Children less than 6 years of age are the group at highest risk for the development of optic pathway gliomas. Although an annual ophthalmologic examination currently is recommended as the most efficient method to screen for optic pathway gliomas, this method is often unreliable and inaccurate in young children. Magnetic resonance imaging remains the most sensitive test; however, cost and the need for sedation or general anaesthetic preclude its use as a routine screening test. We previously have recommended visual-evoked potentials (VEPs) as a possible alternative or aid in the assessment of optic pathway gliomas in this group of patients. The aims of this study were to ascertain the sensitivity of VEPs in detecting optic pathway gliomas and to determine whether VEPs are useful in monitoring the progress of optic pathway gliomas. This study provides further evidence of the sensitivity of VEPs in detecting optic pathway gliomas. In addition, VEPs may provide additional useful information concerning the progression of optic pathway gliomas once they have been detected.

Test-retest analyses for the images were sampled at four locations: 1.5 mm nasal, inferior, temporal, and superior from center. The average standard deviation of all points was used to determine the short-term variability of the measurements. Results. The short-term variability (in diopters) of the Dicon, EyeSys, and Keratron was 0.61 to 3.31 D, 0.94 to 1.51 D, and 0.58 to 2.85 D, respectively, for axial distance maps and 1.07 to 6.82 D, 0.79 to 1.77 D, and 1.23 to 3.03 D for tangential curvature maps.

The rod and cone a-waves were analyzed by using the method described by Hood and Birch (1995, 1997). The parameters Rmp3 (maximum a-wave amplitude) and S (sensitivity) were calculated. RESULTS: In case 1, the rod Rmp3 was decreased in both eyes. The rod S in the right eye was within the normal range, but that in the left eye was significantly reduced. Although the cone Rmp3 was decreased, the cone S was within the normal range. In case 2, the rod and cone Rmp3 was reduced, but the rod and cone S was within the normal range in both eyes. In case 3, the rod and cone Rmp3 and S were within the normal range. CONCLUSIONS: Electroretinograms illustrated different disease stages, however, no eye with normal Rmp3 and decreased S was found in rods and cones. In the early stages of this disease, decreased numbers of photoreceptors and/or outer segment shortening may be present while phototransduction remains normal. As the damage to the retina progresses, phototransduction becomes severely affected. Because reduced cone S was not observed in our cases, cones may be less involved than rods in this disease.

To assess the effectiveness of optometrists as screeners for diabetic retinopathy using slit-lamp binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy through dilated pupils. Methods. Prospective study of a screening scheme. Screening was performed by 27 locally accredited optometrists in their practice. The referral protocol used a new simple grading system of retinopathy, especially designed for use in an optometrist screening programme. All positive referrals and 10% of negative referrals were re-examined by an ophthalmologist. Sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and technical failure rates were calculated. Results. The optometrists screened 4904 people with diabetes in 18 months. 'Subthreshold' (screen negative) reports accounted for 4438 (90.5% of 4904); 429 (9.67%) of these were re-examined at secondary screening. There was disagreement regarding grading in 13 patients, of whom 5 (1.16% of 4.29) had sight-threatening retinopathy (STDR); this extrapolates to 52 patients if all the 4438 test-negatives had been examined. Of the 371 'threshold' patients, 112 (30.18%) were false positives; the commonest cause for false positive referral was drusen in patients with background diabetic retinopathy. The sensitivity for identification of STDR was 76% (95% CI 70% to 81%) and specificity 95% (95% CI 95% to 96%). The likelihood ratio of a positive test indicating STDR was 16.54 (95% CI 14.17 to 19.23) and that of a negative test 0.25 (95% CI 0.20 to 0.32). The technical failure rate was 0.2%. Conclusions. Suitably trained and accredited community optometrists performed well when screening for diabetic retinopathy using slit-lamp biomicroscopy through a dilated pupil. This was facilitated by the use of simple grading and referral criteria. The sensitivity, positive likelihood ratio and specificity were high.","Diabetes mellitus; Mass screening; Optometry; Retinopathy","accreditation; adolescent; adult; aged; article; clinical practice; clinical protocol; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; diagnostic error; disease classification; female; human; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; mydriasis; ophthalmology; ophthalmoscopy; optometry; patient referral; prospective study; screening test; sensitivity and specificity; slit lamp; training; visual system examination",,"Prasad, S.; Arrowe Park Hospital, Department of Ophthalmology, Arrowe Park Road, Upton Wirral CH49 5PE, United Kingdom; email: sprasad@rcsed.ac.uk","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11702969",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034748237

To determine the prevalence and pattern of retinal diseases at the Guinness Eye Hospital, Onitsha, Nigeria. MATERIALS AND METHODS. This was a prospective study. All new patients seen by the author at the outpatients clinic of the Guinness Eye Hospital, Onitsha, Nigeria were examined for evidence of retinal diseases, using the Snellen chart, tonometry, indirect ophthalmoscopy after full mydriasis, slit-lamp examination with a 78D non-contact fundus lens, fundus contact lens examination, and slit-lamp examination of the anterior segment. Ancillary tests performed, as applicable, included Mantoux, skin-snip, hemoglobin genotype, urinalysis, fasting blood sugar, oral glucose tolerance test, full blood count, platelet count, ESR, VDRL, and HIV tests. RESULTS. 8.1% of the patients had retinal diseases. The leading retinal diseases were age-related macular degeneration (ARMD), diabetic retinopathy, retinal vein occlusion, retinal tears/detachment, retinitis pigmentosa and retinochoroiditis with epiretinal membrane. ARMD, diabetic retinopathy, and retinitis pigmentosa often caused bilateral lesions. Bilateral blindness was present in 14% and bilateral visual impairment in 16%, with macular degeneration, retinitis pigmentosa and retinal vascular diseases as major causes. CONCLUSIONS. Retinal diseases may be a significant cause of blindness and visual impairment in this part of Nigeria. Since most of the diseases are treatable with laser and vitrectomy techniques, it is recommended that these facilities be provided in all major eye hospitals in the area.","Blindness; Nigeria; Prevalence; Retinal disease","glucose; hemoglobin; sugar; adult; aged; anterior eye segment; article; blindness; blood cell count; chorioretinitis; clinical trial; contact lens; diabetic retinopathy; electron spin resonance; epiretinal membrane; eye fundus; female; glucose blood level; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; major clinical study; male; mydriasis; Nigeria; ophthalmoscopy; oral glucose tolerance test; prevalence; priority journal; prospective study; retina blood vessel occlusion; retina detachment; retina disease; retina macula age related degeneration; retina tear; retinitis pigmentosa; skin test; slit lamp; thrombocyte count; tuberculin test; urinalysis; venereal disease reaction test; visual impairment; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Blindness; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nigeria; Ophthalmology; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Retinal Diseases; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields",,"Nwosu, S.N.N.; Guinness Eye Center, PMB 1534, Onitsha, Nigeria",,"10652170",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034021299

The purpose of this study was to determine whether this effect is measurable under conditions typical of clinical rather than laboratory settings. A head-mounted infra-red videopupillometer was used to measure the amplitude of pupillary constriction in 12 patients with probable AD, 12 healthy age-matched older adults and 12 young adults. The constriction to the onset of bright light relative to the resting amplitude was significantly reduced in AD compared with both control groups. This result is consistent with an acetylcholine-related deficit in AD and supports the findings of Prettyman et al. and Fotiou et al. The impairment is likely to be caused by degeneration in relays in the midbrain but cholinergic deficits in the peripheral parasympathetic pathway cannot be excluded. The variation in pupillary response between individuals may preclude its use for diagnostic purposes. However, if the changes in pupillary response in AD are related to change in neurotransmitter status, then the value of such a technique may be in its use in providing an objective, non-invasive monitor of physiological abnormality with which to follow disease progression and treatment efficacy. © 2001, Editrice Kurtis.","Aging; Alzheimer's disease; Clinical evaluation; Neuro-ophthalmology; Pupilary light reflex; Vision","acetylcholine; neurotransmitter; adult; aged; aging; Alzheimer disease; article; cholinergic system; clinical article; diagnostic procedure; disease course; female; human; infrared radiation; laboratory; male; measurement; mesencephalon; monitoring; nerve degeneration; pupil reflex; pupillometer; technique; videorecording; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Aging; Alzheimer Disease; Female; Geriatric Assessment; Humans; Light; Male; Middle Aged; Photic Stimulation; Reflex, Abnormal",,"Butler, S.R.; Burden Neurological Institute, Frenchay Hospital, Bristol BS16 1JB, United Kingdom; email: s.r.buther@bristol.ac.uk",,"11845975",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035692429

An ophthalmological examination was performed and clinical data regarding mental development and neurological disease were obtained for all children. Cerebral imaging was performed in 35 children. Results: Twenty-six per cent of the children were found to have ocular disorders only. Forty-two per cent had cerebral morphological abnormalities, verified by cerebral imaging, and 65% had signs of cerebral functional abnormalities. In total, 74% were found to have cerebral morphological and/or cerebral functional abnormalities. Conclusion: The majority of children with visual impairment, including children with ocular disorders, were found to have cerebral morphological and/or cerebral functional abnormalities.

Methods: Ten patients with strabismus and defective stereopsis were compared with ten healthy controls with respect to their performance in a series of automobile driving manoeuvres. The two groups were individually matched as to age, annual miles driven, years of licence holding and type of vehicle owned. After an ophthalmologic examination the subjects in each group performed the following series of driving tests: (1) stopping in front of an obstacle, (2) reversing into a parking space, (3) driving through a slalom course, (4) estimating the relative positions of two cars. All tests were performed binocularly and monocularly (with the non-dominant eye covered). Results: Only in the slalom test did the normal subjects perform significantly better than the stereodeficient subjects (odds ratio 10.5; P<0.01). In estimating position, normal subjects actually performed significantly worse (odds ratio 0.091; P<0.01).

Recent changes in the medical school curriculum and in teaching styles have stimulated the development of novel learning resources. We investigated the impact of computer-aided learning in the field of ophthalmology at a large Australian undergraduate medical school. Methods. Clinical case studies describing common ophthalmic conditions were incorporated into a computing program which uses a problem-solving format. The program was made available to 85 medical students for a 2 week period. A control group of 20 medical students did not have access to this material. Acquisition of new knowledge was assessed as the improvement in score on a knowledge-based multiple-choice examination which students took both before and following the learning interval. Results. Students in the control group showed no improvement over the test period, whilst the students who had access to the computer significantly increased their knowledge base, both for material provided on the program (p = 0.0001) and in related areas (p = 0.0015). Conclusions. Suitably constructed material on the computer is a useful aid in teaching ophthalmology to medical undergraduates.

Method: A retrospective analysis was done of 2425 patients who attended the glaucoma clinic in a tertiary eye-care centre for five years from January1995 to December 1999. A detailed history was obtained and a thorough examination was performed, including gonioscopy, disc assessment, applanation tonometry and automated perimetry. Diurnal variation of IOP and provocative tests for glaucoma were done where applicable. Result: Primary angle closure glaucoma (PACG) was the most common glaucoma subtype. The primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) to the PACG ratio was 37:63. Chronic angle closure glaucoma (CACG) was the most common PACG subtype. The majority of CACG cases were relatively asymptomatic. Male dominance was seen for POAG, juvenile open angle glaucoma (JOAG), CACG, normal tension glaucoma (NTG) and secondary glaucomas. Female dominance was seen for ocular hypertension (OHT), acute or intermittent ACG and developmental glaucomas. The mean age in years at presentation was POAG:60.54 years (males 61.54 years, females 59.01 years) and PACG: 55.13 years (males 57.25 years, females 53.60). The three common secondary glaucoma's were: glaucoma secondary to adherent leucoma, aphakic and pseudophakic glaucomas and traumatic glaucomas. Advanced glaucoma was detected in 42 to 53% of patients and bilateral blindness in 8 to 14% of patients in various subtypes. Conclusion: Compared to Caucasians, glaucoma patients in North India seem to present nearly a decade earlier and the disease is more advanced at presentation. While PACG is the most commonly encountered glaucoma, NTG and exfoliative glaucoma are relatively rare.","Blindness; Glaucoma; North India","adolescent; adult; age distribution; aged; article; child; comparative study; female; glaucoma; gonioscopy; hospital; human; India; infant; intraocular pressure; male; newborn; oculoplethysmography; ophthalmology; pathophysiology; perimetry; physiology; preschool child; retrospective study; sex ratio; Adolescent; Adult; Age Distribution; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Comparative Study; Female; Glaucoma; Gonioscopy; Hospitals, Special; Humans; India; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Intraocular Pressure; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Perimetry; Retrospective Studies; Sex Distribution; Tonometry, Ocular",,"Chaudhuri, Z.; E-310 Purvasha, Anand Lok Society, Mayur Vihar Phase-I, Delhi - 110 091, India; email: drzia@bol.net.in",,"15887712",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-1942429657

Study Design: Retrospective analysis of 65 optic nerve decompressions. Methods: The total collective of optic nerve decompressions comprised 65 patients treated within the period between February 1987 and December 1998. Thirteen of these 65 patients (average age, 32 y) were comatose and required critical care treatment, so visual acuity could not be measured. The indication for surgical decompression in all patients was based on the ophthalmological examination and the finding on computed tomography (CT) scan of a lesion inside the optic nerve canal or the orbit apex, respectively. Results: In the comatose patients the time interval between trauma and surgery was 16.1 ± 12.1 hours (mean ± standard deviation). During the subsequent postoperative examinations (on average, 12.3 mo postoperatively) five patients showed a normal visual acuity (20/20), two patients a visual acuity of 20/30 and 20/50, and one a visual acuity of 20/200. Three patients (three eyes) remained amaurotic. Two patients died of the general and severe consequences of injury. The beneficial visual acuity results achieved within the group of comatose patients were equivalent to those achieved within the group of patients who were conscious during the preoperative examination. The success rate, defined as an improvement of three lines with a final visual acuity of at least 20/1000, was 57.7% versus 61.5%. Conclusion: The results confirm our concept of early decompression of the optic nerve, based on close interdisciplinary cooperation and the ophthalmological findings.","Comatose patients; Early decompression surgery; Traumatic optic neuropathy; Visual acuity","adolescent; adult; aged; article; blindness; child; coma; computer assisted tomography; consciousness; controlled study; female; human; injury; intensive care; major clinical study; male; nerve decompression; ophthalmology; optic nerve disease; priority journal; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Child; Child, Preschool; Coma; Decompression, Surgical; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Nerve Compression Syndromes; Optic Nerve Diseases; Optic Nerve Injuries; Patient Care Team; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Treatment Outcome; Visual Acuity",,"Lübben, B.; Klin./Poliklinik fur HNO-Krankheiten, Westfalische Wilhelms-Univ.

Methods: Twenty-six pediatric age patients with 36 chalazia were divided into 3 groups of 12 chalazia each. The first group received intralesional triamcinolone acetonide 5 mg/ml injection, the 2nd group was treated by simple incision and curettage and the 3rd group was treated by incision, curettage and intralesional triamcinolone acetonide injection on the same session. Results: In the first group, after 2 weeks from receiving intralesional suspension of triamcinolone acetonide injection, 9/12 (75%) of the chalazia had resolved. Two chalazia resolved after 2 weeks from the 2nd injection and one resolved after a 3rd injection. In spite of improvement, 3 patients complained of either recurrence or development of new adjacent lesions. Two patients had yellow deposits at the site of transcutaneous injections. In the 2nd group, 9/12 (75%) lesions resolved after the first surgery, and the other 3 lesions responded to repeated surgery. Recurrence or appearance of new lesions adjacent to the old one was noticed in 2 cases after approximately one month from resolution. In the 3rd group, resolution was found in all patients 12/12 (100%) after 2 weeks, and neither recurrence nor complications were faced. Conclusion: The 3 procedures were safe, effective and convenient. Intralesional corticosteroid injection is a good procedure for children, patients with allergy to local anesthesia, chalazia close to the lacrimal drainage system and it is convenient for physicians other than ophthalmologists. Incision and curettage is recommended for patients with infected chalazia. Combined incision, curettage and intralesional corticosteroid injection is more convenient for patients with large, recurrent and multiple chalazia.","Chalazion; Curettage; Incision; Intralesional corticosteroid injection","antibiotic agent; corticosteroid; local anesthetic agent; triamcinolone acetonide; adolescent; article; chalazion; child; clinical article; controlled study; curettage; dose response; drug hypersensitivity; female; human; incision; intermethod comparison; lacrimal apparatus; male; medical specialist; ophthalmology; physician; pilot study; postoperative complication; prospective study; recurrent disease; safety; Adolescent; Anti-Inflammatory Agents; Chalazion; Child; Child, Preschool; Curettage; Female; Humans; Injections, Intralesional; Male; Pilot Projects; Prospective Studies; Triamcinolone Acetonide",,"Mustafa, T.A.; Opthalmology Clinic, Prince R.

To determine the incidence and the type of flap complications in our initial series of eyes undergoing laser in situ keratomileusis and the impact of microkeratome-related complications on best spectacle-corrected visual acuity. METHODS. We reviewed the charts of the 630 consecutive eyes operated in the Refractive Surgery Department of Cerrahpasa Medical School, University of Istanbul, Turkey using the Hansatome microkeratome and the Summit, SVS Apex Plus excimer laser between March 1998 and November 1999. The mean follow-up was 12.6 months. RESULTS. The incidence of total flap complications was 19.8 %. Flap folds (5%) were the most common complication. The incidence of epithelial ingrowth was 3.3%. Diffuse lamellar keratitis was encountered in 20 cases (3.17%). Displaced flaps were seen shortly after the procedure in 8 eyes (1.26%) and repositioned immediately. Improper keratectomy occurred in 14 eyes (2.2%) and incomplete keratectomy in four procedures (0.63%). The presence of interface debris and hemorrhage was each 1.9%. We observed one interface abscess, which was culture-negative and cured with fortified antibiotics, and one free flap. CONCLUSIONS. Although the LASIK procedure with the Hansatome had an easy learning curve without any of the serious complications that frequently occur in this phase, we still observed flap related complications that affected visual outcome.","Flap complication; LASIK; Microkeratome","antibiotic agent; abscess; adult; antibiotic therapy; article; bleeding; controlled study; device; excimer laser; follow up; human; iatrogenic disease; incidence; keratectomy; keratitis; keratomileusis; major clinical study; medical school; microkeratoma; postoperative complication; priority journal; retrospective study; treatment outcome; Turkey (republic); visual acuity; Adult; Astigmatism; Clinical Competence; Humans; Incidence; Intraoperative Complications; Keratomileusis, Laser In Situ; Myopia; Ophthalmology; Postoperative Complications; Retrospective Studies; Surgical Flaps; Visual Acuity",,"Yildirim, R.Adakent Sitesi ND Blok Daire: 9, Levent/Istanbul 80670, Turkey; email: reny@turk.net",,"11820302",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035717457

This shortcoming may be decreased with the use of a nasal endoscope during probing. This approach is particularly important in the probing training of ophthalmology residents. Methods: An experienced pediatric ophthalmologist performed probings on 11 eyes, and a group of ophthalmology residents under his supervision performed probings on another 11 eyes for CNLO. Their claims of a successful or unsuccessful procedure were evaluated with nasal endoscopy by an ear-nose-throat (ENT) surgeon. The age range of the patients was 8-23 months. Results: The ophthalmologist made two false passages, one of which he was aware, out of 11 eyes. The residents had five false passages, two of which were unclear to them, out of another 11 eyes. No false passages occurred in obstructions at the level of the Hasner valve. None of the successful probings required more than a 30 mm probe introduction into the nasolacrimal canal from the inferior punctum. Conclusion: It seems justified to have a nasal endoscopic evaluation, performed by an ENT surgeon, for probings during the training program of ophthalmology residents. Difficult cases with stenosis proximal to the inferior meatus, prior false passage experience on a particular case, and any indication for silicone tube implantation will benefit from the use of an endoscope during the procedure. In order to achieve the best results in CNLO, the collaborative teamwork of an ophthalmologist and an ENT specialist is necessary.

Before surgery, the naked keratoconic eye exhibited extremely large aberrations that could not be measured unless the patient wore a rigid gas-permeable contact lens. With the lens, the computed point-spread function of the eye was large and multimodal, and simulated retinal images confirmed the patient's subjective report of multiple, overlapping images. After full recovery from surgery, aberrations of the corrected eye were much smaller compared with the presurgical eye, which implied a more compact point-spread function and clearer retinal images. These optical changes were mirrored by an improvement in uncorrected visual acuity from 1.3 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) before surgery to 0 logMAR with spectacle correction after full recovery. We conclude that the Shack-Hartmann aberrometer provides an objective, quantitative assessment of the optical outcome of penetrating keratoplasty that allows the clinician to measure retinal image quality objectively and to accurately simulate the complex visual distortions associated with keratoconus.","Aberrometry; Keratoconus; Optics; Penetrating keratoplasty","Aberrations; Image processing; Ophthalmology; Aberrometers; Transplantation (surgical); aberrometer; adult; article; case report; cornea surgery; cornea transplantation; human; image quality; keratoconus; male; medical instrumentation; optics; optometry; penetrating keratoplasty; priority journal; psychophysics; treatment outcome; visual acuity",,"Thibos, L.N.; School of Optometry, Indiana University, Bloomington, IN 47405, United States; email: thibos@indiana.edu","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11780663",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035670202

Solar retinopathy is a well-recognised clinical entity of macular damage caused by viewing the sun, induced by a photochemical process. The term 'eclipse retinopathy' is frequently employed when the condition is sustained as a result of viewing a solar eclipse. Considerable public excitement had been raised in anticipation of the full solar eclipse on 11 August 1999. Whilst experience has shown that visual morbidity is likely to be temporary, current evidence is anecdotal and restricted to isolated case reports and series. This study was conducted to establish the true visual morbidity associated with a solar eclipse, and whether it was temporary or permanent. Methods. A 3 month active case ascertainment study was carried out from July to September 1999 to record cases presenting to ophthalmologists with visual symptoms arising from solar viewing. Further information about the cases was sought using a short questionnaire. A follow-up questionnaire requesting outcome data at 6 months was also employed. Results. There were 70 reported cases of visual loss. The average age was 29.5 ± 12.9 years. Half the cases presented to an ophthalmologist within 2 days of the eclipse. An abnormal macular appearance was reported in 84% of patients at presentation. There have been no reported cases of continued visual loss or symptoms at 6 months. Conclusions. This is the largest nationwide study of the visual effects of a solar eclipse ever undertaken. There were no recorded cases of permanent visual loss, which corroborates the previous evidence that visual morbidity is likely to be temporary. It would appear probable that public health education was most effective in reducing visual morbidity and hence keeping the consequent burden on the NHS to a minimum.","Eclipse blindness; Eclipse retinopathy; Macula; Photoretinitis; Retina; Solar eclipse; Solar retinopathy","adult; age; article; controlled study; data analysis; eye injury; female; follow up; health education; human; information; major clinical study; male; morbidity; national health service; ophthalmology; outcomes research; photochemistry; public health; questionnaire; retina macula lutea; retinopathy; solar radiation; sun; symptom; time; visual disorder; visual impairment",,"Michaelides, M.; Department of Ophthalmology, Queen Mary's Hospital, Sidcup, Kent DA14 6LT, United Kingdom; email: drmichelmichaelides@hotmail.com","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11339579",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035027587

Accurate and reliable evaluation techniques are essential for clinical and epidemiologic studies. This survey of corneal specialists was designed to lay a foundation for the further development of methods for evaluating and staging pterygium. Methods. In a self-administered, mailed questionnaire, 213 corneal specialists rated the importance of nine symptoms, nine signs, and nine clinical tests for the severity of primary pterygium. Severity was defined as the present need for surgical intervention. Results. The most important factors for determining primary pterygium severity were the extent of encroachment onto the cornea, decreased visual acuity, restricted ocular motility, and increased rate of growth. Many patient symptoms were rated as moderately to highly important. The questionnaire was shown to have good response reliability by test-retest comparisons. Cronbach's α was 0.89, which indicates very good internal consistency reliability. Conclusion. The survey identifies the priorities of experts in determining the severity of pterygium. More precise and clearly defined evaluation methods will enhance future clinical and epidemiologic studies of pterygium. The ranked list of pterygium signs, symptoms, and tests can serve as a guide for developing pterygium evaluation methods in the future. There is a need for a method that accurately and precisely quantifies the distance of pterygium encroachment onto the cornea and the pterygium progression rate. Furthermore, there is a need for an assessment of patient symptoms.","Cornea-Corneal specialist; Evaluation; Measurement; Pterygium","article; cornea; disease severity; eye movement disorder; priority journal; pterygium; tumor growth; visual acuity; Health Surveys; Humans; Ophthalmology; Physician's Practice Patterns; Pterygium; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Severity of Illness Index",,"Twelker, J.D.; School of Optometry, University of California, 360 Minor Hall, Berkeley, CA 94720-2020, United States; email: twelker@uclink4.berkeley.edu",,"10832686",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034113838

The increase in intra-ocular pressure after intubation was greater in the glaucomatous group than in the normal group. The increase in intra-ocular pressure was greater after extubation than intubation in both groups, but was similar in the two groups.

The aim of this study is to report inter- and intraobserver agreement among optometrists and ophthalmologists in optic disc assessment and discuss the implications for glaucoma co-management. Methods: Twelve observers (six optometrists and six ophthalmologists) graded 48 stereo-pairs of optic disc photographs from 48 patients on two separate occasions. Observers graded the vertical C/D ratio, the narrowest rim width and the presence/absence of disc haemorrhage. Agreement was assessed by calculating the standard deviation (SD) of differences and the kappa statistic, within and between observers. Systematic differences in grading between and within individuals were described by calculating mean differences. Results: Intra-observer agreement is ""substantial"" and significantly better than inter-observer agreement for all disc features (P&lt;0.0001). Intra-observer agreement is comparable for optometrists and ophthalmologists with regard to C/D ratio estimates. Although some optometrists show close agreement with ophthalmologists, overall agreement between optometrists and ophthalmologists is significantly worse than agreement among ophthalmologists alone for vertical C/D ratio (P=0.002) and disc haemorrhage (P=0.02). There are fewer inter-observer mean differences that differ significantly from zero among ophthalmologists (7%) than among optometrists (67%; X2=11.63, P&lt;0.001) or between optometrists and ophthalmologists (69%; X2=16.7, P&lt;0.001). There is evidence of systematic under-reading of C/D ratios by less experienced optometrists. Conclusion: Although individual optometrists can show good agreement with ophthalmologists on disc grading, the variation in individual performance indicates that training and accreditation in disc assessment is an essential prerequisite for participation by optometrists in glaucoma co-management.",,"article; bleeding; calculation; clinical article; controlled study; experience; glaucoma; human; medical assessment; medical education; medical expert; medical specialist; observer variation; ophthalmology; optic disk; optometry; performance; priority journal; statistical analysis; Clinical Competence; Glaucoma; Humans; Observer Variation; Ophthalmology; Optic Disk; Optometry; Patient Care Team; Reproducibility of Results",,,,"11482337",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034960585

Methods - Six eyes of six normal volunteers and an artificial nerve fibre layer were examined using the nerve fibre analyser II. The retinal nerve fibre layer thickness (RNFLT) was measured in each of four 90 degree quadrants, superior (S), temporal (T), inferior (I), and nasal (N), at 1.5 disc diameters from the disc margin. Study 1: Measurement in normal eyes. The amount of maximum error in RNFLT measurements was investigated as follows: (1) the intensity setting of the laser beam was changed to be as weak as possible or to be as strong as possible; (2) the intentional offsets of the laser beam axis in relation to the pupil were made in four directions; (3) the eye was rotated by shifting the head 45 or 90 degrees; (4) the right eye was measured by moving it to the left eye position on the head rest. Study 2: Measurements on an artificial nerve fibre layer. The birefringence measurements were confirmed with a plastic disc, which has a radial arrangement of birefringence. The plastic disc with black paper was fixed at the right eye position or the left eye position on the head rest. The retardation of the laser beam by the plastic disc on the black paper was measured. The retardation of the plastic disc was checked by an automatic birefringence evaluation system (ABR-10A, Uniopt Co, Ltd, Shizuoka). Results - Study 1: The effects of the rotated eye and the measurement of the opposite eye position were significant. The eyes rotated 90 degrees showed quite a different pattern in which the thicker and thinner locations of the RNFLT are switched. The nasal RNFLT of the baseline and the 90 degree rotated eye are 41.9 (SD 6.0) μm and 122.5 (11.2) μm, respectively (p<0.0001, Scheffe multiple comparison test). Study 2: The uniform retardation of the plastic disc was observed with the ABR-10A. The NFA detects the retardation of the plastic disc which the retardation map showed as a double humped pattern. Conclusions - Study 2 indicated that the amount of corneal compensation was not small. The cause of significant influences by the rotated eyes and right eyes measurement in left eye position were thought to be incorrect corneal compensation. To increase the diagnostic ability of SLP, an improved compensation of the cornea is thought to be important.",,"adult; article; artifact; artificial organ; autoanalyzer; automation; birefringence; clinical article; comparative study; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic error; eye movement; human; image analysis; image quality; laser; mathematical analysis; polarimetry; priority journal; refraction error; retina nerve cell; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; thickness; Adult; Artifacts; Glaucoma; Humans; Image Processing, Computer-Assisted; Lasers; Nerve Fibers; Ophthalmology; Optic Nerve; Reproducibility of Results; Retina",,"Kogure, S.; Department of Ophthalmology, Yamanashi Medical University, Tamaho, Yamanashi 409-38, Japan; email: skogure@res.yamanashi-med.ac.jp",,"10966956",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033829006

Design: Two prospective interobserver agreement studies. One study compared the agreement between a standard and a TM examination, whereas the other assessed agreement between two independent standard examinations. Participants: Strabismus patients over 4 years of age examined at a remote community clinic and patients assessed in a strabismologist's urban practice. Methods: Forty-two patients were examined in person by a pediatric ophthalmologist at the remote community and independently by a pediatric ophthalmology fellow by means of TM (TM-standard study). The TM examination was performed with the help of a qualified ophthalmic assistant at the remote telecommunication center using a Power Cam 100 camera, a Picture Tel Concorde 4500 teleconferencing system, and a 224 kilobyte bandwidth. For comparison, independent in person examinations were performed on 43 patients by both examiners (standard-standard study). Agreement was measured using unweighted κ (k) for categorical data, the intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) for continuous data, and percent agreement. The odds of disagreement with TM (comparing the TM-standard versus standard-standard studies) was assessed with logistic regression analysis. Main Outcome Measures: Three parameters were assessed: (1) category of strabismus, determined by observation without cover test; (2) angle of deviation at 0.33 and 6.0 m; and (3) ocular muscle action. Results: Agreement on the category of strabismus was good (k > 0.61) other than for vertical deviations. However, there was good to excellent agreement between TM and standard examinations on the vertical (ICC = 0.78) and horizontal (ICC = 0.79) angles of deviation with 6-m fixation with the cover test. Muscle ratings agreed within one point for the lateral, superior, and inferior rectus muscle actions in more than 90% of the eyes examined. Although good agreement was observed in the TM-standard study, it was inferior to the agreement in the standard-standard study. Examination by TM increased the odds of disagreement compared with examination in person by twofold to threefold. Conclusions: Strabismus examination can be performed with a good level of reliability with the use of medium bandwidth video teleconferencing equipment. However, reduced reliability has been noted in the detection of small vertical deviations by inspection and in evaluating oblique muscle actions.

All patients had intracranial bleeding, documented by computed axial tomographic scans of the head. Of the 8 patients, 6 had bilateral retinal hemorrhages. All patients underwent a formal examination by a pediatric ophthalmologist (R.S. and others) using a wide-field digital ophthalmic camera. Three children died. Conclusions: The wide-field digital ophthalmic camera allowed good visualization and produced high-quality photographic images, resulting in instant bedside documentation of retinal pathological features. The wide-field digital ophthalmic camera provides a new tool for the evaluation and precise documentation of retinal hemorrhages in suspected and confirmed cases of abusive head trauma.",,"article; brain hemorrhage; camera; child abuse; clinical article; computer assisted tomography; female; head injury; human; infant; male; medical specialist; ophthalmology; pediatrician; preschool child; priority journal; retina hemorrhage",,"Nakagawa, T.A.; Div. of Pediatric Critical Care Med., Children's Hosp. of King's Daughters, 601 Children's Ln., Norfolk, VA 23507, United States; email: NakagaTA@CHKD.com","American Medical Association","11576011",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034805278

Methods: The average cost of a cataract surgery episode was calculated including one pre-operative visit, the surgery itself and the post-operative visits. Included in the analysis were the costs of disposables, personnel, rent, depreciation, general anaesthesia, bed days and education. Excluded were the costs of complications and overhead costs. Results: The average cost for one cataract surgery episode was 5052/6915 SEK (1 Euro =8.57 SEK) with a variation from 4436/6202 to 6130/8293 between the clinics. The lower sum represents a minimum cost of personnel, the higher sum a maximum cost. Conclusion: A large variation in costs of cataract surgery was found in four providers of cataract surgery.

This study examines the frequency and outcomes of cataract surgery for patients who were hospitalized overnight compared with those treated as day surgery cases. Methods: Medical records of 671 consecutive admissions for cataract surgery at the Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital were reviewed. Data analysed included demographic features, insurance status, length of hospitalization, ophthalmic conditions, medical conditions, social problems and planned surgical technique. Ophthalmic and anaesthetic complications, active ophthalmic and medical interventions were also studied. Results: Of the 671 patient admissions for cataract during the study period, 226 (33.4%) were hospitalized overnight. Factors significantly associated with overnight hospitalization in univariate analyses include older age, female sex, country residence, Veterans' Affairs insurance, monocular vision status, pre-existing ischaemic heart disease, pre-existing asthma/chronic obstructive lung disease, absence of carer, transportation problems, planned extra-capsular cataract extraction technique, ophthalmic complications and active ophthalmic and/or medical interventions. After adjusting for possible confounding factors using backwards stepwise multivariate logistic regression models all except pre-existing ischaemic heart disease and ophthalmic complications were significantly associated with overnight admission for cataract surgery. In total, 14 cases (2.1%) needed active ophthalmic and/or medical interventions, 13 overnight cases and one day case. Conclusions: These data suggest that many patients who are hospitalized overnight for cataract surgery could be safely treated as day cases. Such a shift in the pattern of care for cataract surgery could provide a significant potential for health care savings.","Cataract extraction; Day case; Overnight stay","glucose; insulin; oral antidiabetic agent; aged; article; Australia; cataract; cataract extraction; clinical trial; cost control; diabetes mellitus; factorial analysis; female; hospital admission; human; length of stay; major clinical study; male; patient care; phacoemulsification; resource allocation; surgical approach; treatment outcome; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Ambulatory Care; Cataract Extraction; Female; Hospitalization; Hospitals, Special; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Outpatients; Patient Admission; Retrospective Studies; Victoria",,"Atalla, M.L.; Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, 32 Gisborne Street, East Melbourne, Vic. 3002, Australia; email: atalla@bluep.com",,"10933769",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033909641

Methods: Three groups of examiners with varying amounts of experience in eye movement detection tasks were studied. Eight examiners were 1st-year optometry students, six were 4th-year optometry students, and six were practicing optometrists. To determine thresholds for eye movement detection, examiners indicated the horizontal direction in which the eyes of one of the experimenters moved. The direction and extent of each eye movement was randomly selected. The extent of the eye movement was one of eight logarithmic steps from a maximum that was determined through an initial session where the approximate sensitivity of the examiners was found (generally ± 1.75 prism diopters). Results: Detection thresholds were determined by fitting the data with a cumulative Gaussian function. The mean horizontal eye movement eye movement necessary to obtain 99% correct judgments was 2.65 prism diopters for the 1st-year students, 2.47 prism diopters for the 4th-year students, and 2.40 prism diopters for the practicing optometrists. Conclusions: The results indicate that during ideal conditions, little or no training is required for efficient detection of small eye movements.To determine whether experience improves detection of small eye movements, three groups of examiners with varying amounts of experience in eye movement detection tasks were studied.

Therefore, the importance of ophthalmic assessment in making the diagnosis has to be stressed. Methods: The history and ocular findings of a patient with MEN 2b syndrome are described, and a brief overview of the syndrome is given. Results: Slit-lamp examination showed extremely thickened corneal nerves as well as multiple small plexiform and nodular subconjunctival tumors. Both eyes also displayed thickened upper and lower eyelids. A molecular genetic study of the RET proto-oncogene showed a heterozygous ATG to ACG mutation in codon 918 of exon 16.

Hypertension is considered to be a contraindication in potential renal transplant donors. Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM) was developed as an alternative to in-office blood pressure measurement (OBPM). The aim of this study was to determine the sensitivity of ABPM in revealing hypertension in potential renal transplant donors, and to measure the correlation between ABPM results and target organ damage. Methods. The study included 126 potential living-related renal transplant donors. The potential donors' blood pressures were measured during three separate clinic visits and then evaluated using 24-h ABPM. Cardiac and ophthalmological examinations were also performed to investigate target organ damage in all of the donors. Results. According to the OBPM, 89 potential donors were normotensive and 37 had borderline or mild hypertension. Of the normotensive group, six were diagnosed as hypertensive after 24-h ABPM, and these subjects had target organ involvement. The status of the other 83 donors remained unchanged after ABPM and investigation for target organ damage. Thirteen of the 37 subjects who had borderline or mildly elevated pressures on OBPM were classified as normotensive after ABPM. These 13 individuals exhibited no hypertension-related target organ damage. The other 24 patients who had been classified as borderline:or mildly hypertensive on OBPM fulfilled the criteria for hypertension after ABPM, and hypertensive changes were found at target organ evaluation. Before donor nephrectomy, 94 subjects who were classified as normotensive prior to transplantation underwent renal angiography for routine pretransplant evaluation, and none showed hypertensive or atherosclerotic changes. Conclusion. In our study, ABPM was found to be more sensitive than OBPM in terms of identifying hypertension in potential renal transplant donors.","Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring; Hypertension; Renal transplant donors","adult; ambulatory monitoring; article; blood pressure monitoring; cardiology; female; human; hypertension; kidney angiography; kidney donor; kidney transplantation; living donor; major clinical study; male; medical examination; ophthalmology; priority journal; treatment contraindication",,"Nurhan Ozdemir, F.; Baskent University, Faculty of Medicine, Fev.

Aim - To identify the eye changes associated with vigabatrin, based on a prospective study of children treated for seizures. Methods - Twenty nine children on vigabatrin (mainly as add on therapy) were followed up for 6.5 years. Ophthalmic examination was performed before starting treatment and then six monthly in the outpatient clinic. Results - Twenty one children fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Most had epileptic syndromes with infantile spasms - namely West syndrome, Lennox-Gastaut syndrome, and partial seizures. Vigabatrin dose was 25-114 mg/kg/day (mean 55.8); duration of therapy was 6-85 months (mean 35.7). Four children (19%) developed eye changes (retinal pigmentation, hypopigmented retinal spots, vascular sheathing, and optic atrophy). Visual evoked potentials were abnormal in 16 children. Electroretinography and electro-oculography, which could have picked up eye changes in early stages, were not performed, as this facility was not available. Conclusions - Vigabatrin causes eye damage. Most children with epileptic syndromes on vigabatrin cannot complain of their eye problems, hence 3-6 monthly ophthalmic follow up is strongly advised, along with regular electroretinography, electro-oculography, and visual evoked potentials if possible.","Epilepsy; Retinal dysfunction; Vigabatrin","vigabatrin; add on therapy; article; child; clinical article; drug effect; electrooculography; electroretinography; epilepsy; evoked visual response; eye injury; female; focal epilepsy; follow up; human; infantile spasm; Lennox Gastaut syndrome; male; Oman; ophthalmology; optic nerve atrophy; outpatient department; priority journal; prospective study; retina disease; retina pigment degeneration; West syndrome; Adolescent; Anticonvulsants; Child; Child, Preschool; Drug Therapy, Combination; Epilepsy; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Optic Atrophy; Pigmentation Disorders; Prospective Studies; Retinal Diseases; Syndrome; Vigabatrin",,"Koul, R.; Department of Child Health, Division of Paediatric Neurology, Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, PO Box 38, Zip Code 123, Qaboos, Oman; email: rkoul@omantel.net.om",,"11719329",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035200166

Intraocular lenses were received by 97% of patients (1154). Surgical techniques used were SISCS, phacoemulsification, and standard extracapsular cataract extraction (ECCE) technique. RESULTS: Postoperatively, 60.0% attained uncorrected vision of 6/24 or better. There was little difference in visual results or complication rates among the three techniques. The most striking finding is the speed of SISCS, which enables experienced surgeons to perform the technique in 3.8 to 4.2 minutes.

Methods: Twenty-three eyes of 13 patients with visible ONHD and 26 eyes of 13 age- and sex-matched control subjects were involved in the study. Ophthalmologic examination, scanning laser polarimetry with nerve fiber analyser (NFA) type II GDX, automated Humphrey visual field testing, and red-free fundus photography were performed. Eyes with ONHD were classified from grade 0 to III according to the amount of visible drusen. Thus, grade 0 discs had no clinically visible ONHD and grade III discs represented the presence of dense drusen. Results: Measurements with NFA of RNFL thickness retardation showed significant decrease in eyes with visible ONHD compared with control eyes (P < 0.05). Although no significant difference was found between grade I and grade II discs regarding NFA measurements, grade III discs had significantly lower values, indicating the greater amount of RNFL loss with higher grade ONHD. Documentation of increased percentage of visual field defects with higher grade drusen was also in accordance with this finding. Conclusions: NFA can quantitatively detect the decrease in retardation of RNFL thickness in eyes with visible ONHD and can be used as an indicator of nerve fiber layer loss in these cases.","Nerve fiber analyser; Optic nerve head drusen; Retinal nerve fiber layer; Visual field","adolescent; adult; aged; article; automation; clinical article; controlled study; disease classification; disease severity; drusen; female; human; laser; male; nerve fiber; ophthalmology; optic nerve; polarimetry; priority journal; school child; thickness",,"Kadayifçilar, S.; Hacettepe Hastanesi Goz ABD, Sihhiye 06100, Ankara, Turkey; email: sibelkd@mailcity.com","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11756852",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035662975

To develop a version of the Melbourne Low-Vision ADL Index that measures the personal impact of disability in activities of daily living (ADL's). Also, to determine the relationship between clinical measures of vision impairment and disability impact. Methods. The Melbourne Low-Vision ADL Index (MLVAI) is a desk-based clinical assessment of disability in ADL's. Ability to perform each item is rated on a five-level descriptive scale from zero to four. In this study, the original version of the MLVAI was modified to measure disability impact. The simple modification involved weighting each item by the importance of that item to the person being tested. Importance was also rated on a five-level scale from zero to four. The validity and reliability of the Weighted Melbourne Low-Vision ADL Index (MLVAIw) was determined for 97 vision-impaired subjects in a cross-sectional study. Results. Cronbach's alpha coefficient indicated an internal reliability of 0.94, and an intraclass correlation coefficient indicated an overall reliability of 0.88. The standard error of measurement was 24.7 points (out of a possible score of 400). There was a statistically significant difference in test scores between normal subjects and vision-impaired subjects. All vision measures had a high, statistically significant correlation with MLVAIw score. Near-word acuity had the strongest correlation (rs = 0.78, p &lt; 0.001), followed by Melbourne Edge Test contrast sensitivity (rs = -0.72, p &lt; 0.001). Visual field had the weakest correlation (rs = -0.52, p &lt; 0.001). The best predictive model of MLVAIw score incorporated the variables age, near-word acuity, and visual field. Together, these variables accounted for 65.1% of the variance in MLVAIw score. Conclusions. The MLVAI is highly valid and reliable when weighted by a scale that reflects the personal importance of ADL's. The MLVAIw can provide information over and above that obtained with the usual clinical vision measures and may be used to assess low-vision patients and to measure low-vision rehabilitation outcomes. It is suggested that the assessment of disability using the original MLVAI and the assessment of the impact of disability using the MLVAIw should be kept separate to facilitate the clear interpretation of the outcomes of low-vision rehabilitation.","Activities of daily living; Disability; Disability impact; Functional assessment; Low vision","Correlation methods; Ophthalmology; Patient monitoring; Patient rehabilitation; Vision impairment; Vision; article; Australia; correlation function; daily life activity; disability; human; major clinical study; priority journal; rating scale; scoring system; visual impairment",,"Haymes, S.A.; University of Melbourne, Cnr Cardigan and Keppel Sts, Carlton, Vic. 3053, Australia; email: s.haymes@optometry.unimelb.eau.au","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11525547",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034861507

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS - A cross-sectional telephone survey was conducted among a sample of adults (≥18 years of age) with self-reported diabetes. Recommended preventive care was defined based on four criteria: number of health-care provider (HCP) visits per year (≥4 for insulin users and ≥2 for nonusers), number of foot examinations per year (≥4 for insulin users and ≥2 for nonusers), an annual dilated eye examination, and a blood pressure measurement in the past 6 months. RESULTS - The mean age of the 640 respondents was 61 years, 58% were women, and 86% were white. In the preceding year, 62% of respondents reported the appropriate number of visits to a HCP, 27% the appropriate number of foot examinations, 65% an annual dilated eye examination, and 89% a blood pressure measurement in the preceding 6 months. Only 17% (95% CI 14-20) met all four criteria for recommended care. The adjusted odds of receiving recommended care were higher for males than for females (odds ratio [OR] 1.6; 95% CI 1.1-2.5), higher for people whose HCP scheduled follow-up appointments than for those who self- initiated follow-up (OR 2.7; 95% CI 1.6-4.8), and higher for former smokers than for current smokers (OR 3.1; 95% CI 1.6-6.9). CONCLUSIONS - Preventive care for people with diabetes is not being delivered in compliance with current guidelines, especially for women and current smokers. Scheduling follow-up visits for patients, targeting certain high-risk populations, and developing protocols to improve foot care may be effective in improving care.",,"adult; article; blood pressure measurement; consultation; diabetes mellitus; female; foot; health care delivery; high risk population; human; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology; physical examination; prevalence; preventive medicine; United States",,"Ahluwalia, H.K.; Department of Pediatrics, Univ. of Kansas School of Medicine, Kansas City, KS 66160, United States; email: hahluwalia@kumc.edu","American Diabetes Association Inc.","10857939",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034071750

Methods: A complete ophthalmologic evaluation, including fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography, was performed. Results: A patient with exacerbation of UC was referred to our department for sudden visual loss in RE. Ophthalmoscopy disclosed multifocal yellow-white placoid lesions typical of APMPPE in RE. There were no lesions in the fellow eye. On fluorescein angiography (FA), the active lesions showed early hypofluorescence, followed by late staining. Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) revealed early and late hypofluorescence corresponding to the lesions observed clinically, and late anular staining surrounding a hypofluorescent lesion at the posterior pole. On LE ICGA revealed lesions not detected with ophthalmoscopy and FA. After corticosteroid therapy the lesions healed. Conclusion: Ulcerative Colitis may be responsible for the onset of AMPPPE by an immunological mechanism of delayed type hypersensitivity reaction.","Acute posterior multifocal placoid pigment epitheliopathy(APMPPE); Ulcerative colitis (UC)","corticosteroid; fluorescein; indocyanine green; prednisone; adult; article; case report; clinical feature; controlled study; delayed hypersensitivity; disease association; disease exacerbation; evaluation; female; fluorescence; fluorescence angiography; human; immunology; indocyanine green angiography; ophthalmology; ophthalmoscopy; patient referral; priority journal; retina pigment epitheliopathy; staining; ulcerative colitis; visual impairment; Acute Disease; Adult; Colitis, Ulcerative; Female; Fluorescein Angiography; Glucocorticoids; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Ophthalmoscopy; Pigment Epithelium of Eye; Prednisone; Retinal Diseases; Visual Acuity",,"Parodi, M.B.; Eye Clinic, University of Trieste, Ospedale Maggiore, 34129 Trieste, Italy",,"11401649",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034972635

To ascertain the occurrence and characteristics of uveitis in sibling pairs affected with juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA). Methods. The sibling series comprised 80 JIA patients from 37 families with two or three JIA children, seen at the paediatric department of the Rheumatism Foundation Hospital in Heinola, Finland. An ophthalmologist examined the children for uveitis two to four times a year and the course of the condition was recorded during the follow-up. Results. Uveitis was diagnosed in 21 of the 80 patients (26%). Three pairs (3.4 pairs expected) were concordant for the presence of asymptomatic uveitis. Two patients with enthesitis-related arthritis had acute unilateral uveitis. Among the remaining cases, uveitis was chronic and continuously active at the end of follow-up in 13 instances, but in spite of this only one patient had impaired vision. HLA allele B27 occurred more frequently in patients with uveitis than in those without uveitis (52 vs 30%, P=0.073) and all six subjects in the pairs concordant for chronic uveitis carried this allele. Conclusions. The observed concordance rate for uveitis did not differ from that expected. Although the uveitis was chronic in most instances, its course was usually mild.","Juvenile idiopathic arthritis; Siblings; Uveitis","HLA B27 antigen; allele; article; child; chronic disease; clinical article; controlled study; disease activity; disease course; enthesitis; family; female; Finland; follow up; HLA system; hospital; human; incidence; juvenile rheumatoid arthritis; male; ophthalmology; pediatrics; priority journal; sibling; symptom; uveitis; visual impairment; Adolescent; Arthritis; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Humans; Infant; Male; Uveitis",,"Kotaniemi, K.; Rheumatism Foundation Hospital, FIN-18120 Heinola, Finland",,"11257162",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035090656

Method: A total of 793 questionnaires related to the content and teaching of undergraduate ophthalmology were sent to ophthalmologists, general practitioners and optometrists. Results were analysed separately for the three respondent groups and as a whole. Results: Four hundred and fourteen questionnaires were returned (52% return rate). Overall responses of the three participant groups were similar and agreed favourably with the current curriculum. The ability to measure visual acuity (97%) and pupillary reflexes (93%), perform ophthalmoscopy (92%), and assess visual fields (68%) were regarded as 'important or essential' by the majority of respondents. Only 53% of respondents consider the ability to diagnose chronic open angle glaucoma as important. The respondents stressed the importance of the diagnosis of predominantly anterior segment disease contrasting with the traditional bias towards the teaching of ophthalmoscopy and posterior segment disease. The majority of respondents stressed the importance of graduating medical students being able to treat bacterial and allergic conjunctivitis, styes, blepharitis, corneal abrasion, and corneal and conjunctival foreign bodies, areas present but not normally emphasized in current curricula.

Our objective was therefore to describe the utilization of healthcare by VLBW infants during their first year of life and its relation to high-risk diagnoses in the neonatal period. The study group comprised 36 infants born at gestational ages of ≤31 wk and with a birthweight of ≤1500 g, and was compared with a control group of 36 full-term infants. Utililization of healthcare by the VLBW infants was higher than that by the control group in paediatric and ophthalmic outpatient clinics. The total number of contacts with healthcare was on average 38.7 versus 17.4. High-risk diagnoses in the neonatal period did not correlate with utilization of care, except for visits to the paediatric outpatient clinic, especially planned visits. Further studies focusing on how to support these families after leaving hospital are therefore needed.","Neonatal care; Utilization of healthcare; Very-low-birthweight infants","article; birth weight; clinical article; controlled study; female; gestational age; health care utilization; high risk population; human; infant; male; newborn care; newborn period; ophthalmology; outpatient; pediatrics; periodic medical examination; priority journal; Sweden; very low birth weight; Age Factors; Child Health Services; Female; Health Status; Humans; Infant, Newborn; Infant, Premature; Infant, Very Low Birth Weight; Male; Retrospective Studies; Sweden; Utilization Review",,"Jackson, K.; Department of Caring Sciences, Örebro UniversitySweden; email: karin.jackson@ivo.oru.se",,"11236053",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035103687

To examine rheumatologists' attitudes toward routine ophthalmologic screening for hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) retinopathy and to estimate the acceptability of hypothetical guidelines discouraging this practice. Methods. We E-mailed a random sample of 300 US rheumatologists listed in the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) Directory who treat adults. We asked about current screening practice, reasons for screening, and the effect of hypothetical guidelines discouraging routine screening on future practice. Associations between adherence to guidelines and clinical variables were evaluated using multiple logistic regression. Results. Of 56% who responded, almost all (94%) currently screen their patients at least once per year. Seventy-five percent stated that they would continue to screen because they are unwilling to accept any risk of visual loss among their patients; 74% would continue to screen because of legal liability; and 56% felt their patients would insist on being screened regardless of their physician's opinion. Forty-four percent stated that they would continue to screen regularly, even if the ACR published guidelines discouraging routine screening. Rheumatologists unwilling to accept any risk of retinopathy were less likely to follow guidelines discouraging screening (46 vs 77%, adjusted OR 0.2, 95% CI 0.1-0.6). Patient insistence and fear of legal liability were not significantly associated with predicted adherence to guidelines. Conclusion. Our survey indicates that the majority of rheumatologists currently routinely screen their patients for HCQ retinopathy, and that many would not follow ACR guidelines discouraging this practice, at least in part because they are unwilling to accept any risk of visual damage.","Hydroxychloroquine; Physician attitudes; Screening guidelines; Toxicity","hydroxychloroquine; article; attitude; clinical practice; controlled study; evaluation; female; human; legal aspect; male; medical liability; medical specialist; ophthalmology; practice guideline; prediction; priority journal; retinopathy; rheumatology; risk factor; screening; Antirheumatic Agents; Attitude of Health Personnel; Female; Humans; Hydroxychloroquine; Liability, Legal; Male; Mass Screening; Practice Guidelines; Professional Practice; Retinal Diseases; Rheumatology; Risk Management; United States; Vision, Low",,"Fraenkel, L.; Yale University, Department of Internal Medicine, Section of Rheumatology, 333 Cedar Street, New Haven, CT 06520-8031, United States; email: liana.fraenkel@med.va.gov",,"11409112",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034991291

Results: Of the 10 patients who had SR recession of the affected eye, 9 were satisfactorily alleviated of their vertical deviation with elimination of the forced tilt difference, whereas one patient developed the SRSy in the fellow eye soon after surgery. The patient who had the Knapp procedure to the fellow eye showed, one week postoperatively, full sursumduction of that eye with significant bilateral DVD. Conclusion: SRSy is a common syndrome of several various etiologies. Not infrequently, whether or not associated with DVD, it may masquerade as weakness of the contralateral inferior oblique and/or superior rectus muscles. The treatment of choice is weakening of the overacting contracted SR muscle.","Bielschowsky Head Tilt Test; Dissociated vertical deviation; Double elevator palsy; Duane's Syndrome; Extraocular muscles, 'forced' head tilt test; Hypertropia; Inferior oblique muscle, palsy; Jampolsky Syndrome; Overaction/contracture; Strabismus surgery, superior rectus muscle, surgery, strabismus","adolescent; adult; aged; article; child; clinical article; contracture; Duane retraction syndrome; extraocular muscle; eye movement control; female; gaze; head tilting; human; inferior oblique muscle; jampolsky syndrome; male; ophthalmology; prevalence; priority journal; strabismus; strabismus surgery; Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Child, Preschool; Contracture; Diagnosis, Differential; Eye Movements; Humans; Middle Aged; Ocular Motility Disorders; Oculomotor Muscles; Oculomotor Nerve Diseases; Prevalence; Prognosis; Syndrome; Tilt-Table Test",,"Khawam, E.; Dept Ophthalmology, American University of Beirut, Beirut, Lebanon",,"11093093",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033661738

Forty-five patients were included. Medical history, physical examination, cardiac and ophthalmologic evaluation, clinical chemical investigations, in vivo function tests, neuroimaging and a skeletal muscle biopsy were performed in all patients. The results of the biochemical muscle studies were compared with the results of the other investigations. First, parameters with a statistical relationship with the result in muscle, normal or deficient, were selected. Secondly, a prognostic index was constructed using these parameters. Five parameters were selected: age < 4 years, elevated fasting lactate to pyruvate ratio, elevated thrombocyte count, elevated lactate, and elevated alanine. Each parameter was scored 0 (not present) or 1 (present). The chance of a normal biopsy with a given value of this index (sum of the scores) was calculated: logit (Pr) = α + β x index; α: -0.8167 and β: 0.8331. (Pr: probability of normal biopsy.) The chance of a normal biopsy with an index value of 5 is 0.03, 4 is 0.07, 3 is 0.16, 2 is 0.30, 1 is 0.50 and 0 is 0.69. This prognostic index is a valuable instrument in deciding whether the suspicion of mitochondriocytopathy is strong enough to merit a muscle biopsy.","Children; Diagnosis; Mitochondriocytopathies; Skeletal muscle","alanine; lactic acid; pyruvic acid; adolescent; adult; anamnesis; article; biochemistry; cardiology; child; clinical article; diagnostic imaging; diet restriction; disorders of mitochondrial functions; female; human; human cell; human tissue; infant; male; muscle biopsy; newborn; ophthalmology; physical examination; priority journal; prognosis; statistics; thrombocyte count; Adolescent; Adult; Biopsy; Child; Child, Preschool; DNA, Mitochondrial; Electron Transport; Female; Humans; Infant; Infant, Newborn; Lactic Acid; Male; MELAS Syndrome; Mitochondrial ADP, ATP Translocases; Muscle, Skeletal; Oxidative Stress; Phosphorylation; Prognosis; Pyruvate Dehydrogenase Complex; Reference Values; Severity of Illness Index",,"Rubio-Gozalbo, M.E.; Nijmegen Ctr.

Patients and methods: Thirty eyes of 30 patients with macular holes and epiretinal membranes (visual acuity 0.05-0.5) aged 64 ± 13 years, were examined using automatic threshold fundus perimetry with simultaneous observation of fixation, as well as a special fixation task with the scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO). In addition, area and depth of the holes were measured using scanning laser tomography (Heidelberg retina tomograph). Results: All 21 eyes with full thickness macular holes (0.06-0.75 mm2 area; 0.06-0.53 mm depth) showed an absolute scotoma inside of the hole with location of the fixation area at the left border or top of the hole. In contrast, the patients with impending holes or epiretinal membranes (0.14-0.32 mm2 area, 0.09-0.17 mm depth) could detect bright stimuli during perimetry (10-20 dB and 3-9 dB, respectively). We observed a reduced light increment sensibility (4-13 dB) surrounding the full thickness hole in 15 eyes, either with attached or detached retina. Conclusions: Fundus perimetry with simultaneous documentation of fixation offers the option to detect functional differences between macular holes and changes secondary to epiretinal membrane formation. There is an area of reduced function even in eyes with clinically and tomographically attached retina surrounding the hole which might influence surgical results.","Epiretinal membrane; Fixation; Fundus perimetry; Macular hole; Scanning laser ophthalmoscope; Scanning laser tomography","adult; aged; article; clinical article; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic accuracy; epiretinal membrane; eye fixation; eye fundus; female; human; laser; light; male; medical documentation; ophthalmology; perimetry; retina; retina detachment; retina disease; retina macula hole; retina macula lutea; scanning laser ophthalmoscope; scotoma; tomography; visual acuity; visual stimulation; visual system function; visual threshold; Adult; Aged; Epiretinal Membrane; Female; Fibrosis; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Lasers; Macula Lutea; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmoscopy; Perimetry; Reproducibility of Results; Retinal Detachment; Retinal Perforations; Scotoma; Sensitivity and Specificity; Tomography; Visual Acuity",,"Rohrschneider, K.; Univ.-Augenklinik, Im Neuenheimer Feld 400, D-69120 Heidelberg, Germany; email: Klaus_Rohrschneider@med.uni-heidelberg.de",,"12678392",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0242500850

Methods: There were 128 members in the family. Of these, 45 had an ophthalmological examination and 3 gave their permission to use the results of their recent ophthalmological examination. In addition to the usual eye examination, visual fields, colour vision, dark adaptation and electroretinogram (ERG) were examined. Results: Ten affected men aged 6 to 81 years were found in the family. The visual acuities varied from counting fingers (cf) 10 cm to 0.5 in the right eye (RE) and from cf 30 cm to 0.4 in the left eye (LE). The refraction was myopic in all affected members, varying from -1.5 to -24.0 D (RE) and from -2.0 to -20.25 D (LE). In visual functions, central scotomas and concentric constriction in the visual fields, red or red-green defects in colour vision, abnormal cone and rod dark adaptation and affected cone response in ERG were found. The 6 obligate carriers were aged 17 to 77 years. Their visual acuities varied from 0.05 (strabismic amblyopia) to 1.25(RE) and from 0.7 to 1.25 (LE), and refraction from ±0 to +6.0 D (RE) and from -0.5 to +5.0 D (LE). Their visual fields and colour vision were normal. The non-affected men were aged 13 to 55 years, their visual acuity was normal in both eyes, and refraction varied from -5.0 to +1.5 D (RE) and from -5.5 to +1.75 (LE). The result of the eye examination was normal except in colour vision: two men were congenitally deuteranomalous. The women who were not obligate carriers were aged 10 to 77 years, their visual acuity was from 0.3 to 1.6 in both eyes, and refraction from -5.5 to +4.75 (RE) and from -5.25 to +4.0 (LE). Two women had one amblyopic eye. Otherwise the eye examination was normal. Conclusions: The clinical diagnosis of X-linked cone dystrophy 1 (COD1) is based on progressive loss of visual acuity, moderate or high myopia, red colour vision defect and affected cone response or cone and rod response in ERG. The future identification of the COD1 gene will confirm the diagnosis of the disease and help in genetic counseling of the family.","COD1; Colour vision defect; Family study; Follow-up study; High myopia","adult; age; aged; amblyopia; article; child; clinical article; clinical feature; color vision; controlled study; dark adaptation; electroretinogram; eye refraction; family; follow up; genetic counseling; heterozygote; human; male; myopia; ophthalmology; priority journal; retina cone; retina dystrophy; retina rod; scotoma; vision; visual acuity; visual field; visual impairment; X chromosome linkage; Adult; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Child; Color Perception; Color Vision Defects; Dark Adaptation; Disease Progression; Electroretinography; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Humans; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Middle Aged; Myopia; Pedigree; Photoreceptors, Vertebrate; Retinal Degeneration; Visual Acuity; Visual Fields; X Chromosome",,"Mäntyjärvi, M.; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Kuopio, P.O.B. 1627, 70211 Kuopio, Finland; email: maija.mantyjarvi@uku.fi",,"11453854",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034927436

Methods: An epidemiological study was carried out by a questionnaire aimed at investigating the prevalence of ocular discomfort symptoms among 213 subjects working in operating rooms and 40 subjects working in the wards. The investigated symptoms were the following: tiredness, heaviness, burning, redness, tearing, itching, blinking, foreign body sensation, and photophobia. A randomised comparative study of the ocular surface and conjunctival cytology was also carried out, comparing two groups of age- and gender-matched subjects. Group 1 included 24 subjects randomly chosen from the operating room workers with ocular discomfort symptoms; group 2 included ten subjects randomly enrolled from hospital personnel working in the wards. Ophthalmological examination of the ocular surface was performed on each subject in the following order: slit-lamp examination, break-up time (BUT) of the pre-corneal tear film, corneal fluorescein stain, lachrymal basal secretion test, conjunctival impression cytology. Results: A high prevalence (72.3%) of ocular discomfort symptoms was reported by operating room workers, while in ward personnel the prevalence was 55% (P = 0.04). The ocular tests showed that the conjunctival features and BUT were statistically significantly altered in subjects in group 1. Also, the conjunctival impression cytology study showed statistically significant alterations of all the investigated parameters: specimen cellularity, cell-to-cell contacts, nucleus/cytoplasm ratio, chromatin pattern, goblet cell distribution, keratinisation and the total cytological score. Conclusions: Our results show that self-reported eye complaints and ocular surface alterations have a high prevalence in subjects working in the operating rooms. This seems to indicate that the operating room environment could play a role in the onset of the eye disturbances.","Conjunctival alterations; Impression cytology; Ocular discomfort; Operating rooms","adult; age; article; blinking; conjunctiva; conjunctiva disease; cytology; eye disease; female; gender; human; intraocular foreign body; Italy; major clinical study; male; operating room; operating room personnel; ophthalmology; photophobia; pilot study; prevalence; questionnaire; slit lamp; statistical analysis; symptom; tear film; tear flow; ward; work environment; Adult; Case-Control Studies; Conjunctiva; Conjunctival Diseases; Eye Diseases; Female; Humans; Italy; Male; Middle Aged; Operating Rooms; Personnel, Hospital; Pilot Projects; Prevalence; Statistics, Nonparametric",,"Fenga, C.; Institutes of Occupational Health, Policlinico Universitario, Pad H, Via Consolare, Valeria-Gazzi, 98124 Messina, Italy; email: germanod@imeuniv.unime.it",,"11317705",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035097041

Method: Distance heterophoria was measured using a Maddox Rod, and near heterophoria was measured using a Maddox Wing. In addition, near measurements were repeated with a +3.00 D lens in front of each eye to place the targets at optical infinity. In each case, the standard deviation of the five values was taken as a metric of the test variability. Results: On average, the variability of the Maddox Rod was half of the Maddox Wing, both with and without the lenses.

Glaucomatous damage interpretation was significantly different (p = 0.006) based upon an optometrist's practice setting. Interobserver agreement regarding C/D ratios is significantly higher among optometrists who have completed a residency (κW = 0.59) and practice in clinical settings (optometry school/medical center/hospital) (κW = 0.59) compared with non-residency-trained optometrists (κW = 0.52) and those practicing in commercial settings (κW = 0.54). Interobserver agreement of glaucomatous damage is significantly higher among optometrists who have completed a residency (κ = 0.50) compared with non-residency-trained optometrists (κ = 0.42). Conclusions: Intraobserver agreement is higher than interobserver agreement among optometrists when C/D ratios are estimated and the glaucomatous status of the optic nerve is assessed. Optic nerve evaluation among optometrists is significantly influenced by residency training, practice setting, and glaucoma patient encounters.","C/D; Cup-to-disk ratio; Glaucoma; Optic nerve; Optometrist","Biological materials; Diagnosis; Diseases; Estimation; Neurophysiology; Ophthalmology; Cup to disk ratio; Glaucoma; Glaucoma patient experience; Optic nerve; Optometrist; Practice setting; Residency training; Stereoscopic optic nerve photographs; Vision; article; competence; glaucoma; human; observer variation; optic nerve; optometry; priority journal; residency education",,"Spalding, J.M.; Orlando VA Healthcare Ctr.-Eye Clin., 5201 Raymond Street, Orlando, FL 32803, United States","Williams & Wilkins Co, Baltimore","11014671",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034282228

Some of the pathologies that could compromise endothelial cell morphology are trauma, cataract, surgery, use of contact lenses, corneal dystropies or degenerations. The quantitative analysis of cell shape and cellular pattern is more sensitive in detecting subtle changes in endothelial morphology than cell density measurement or cell area analysis. In this paper, the morphology of the central cornea, the most important area from the point of view of vision, is studied through an associated bivariate spatial point pattern: the centroids of the cells and the triple points, that is, the points where three different cells converge. Nine different summary descriptors (widely used in the statistical analysis of spatial point patterns) have been used: the empty space distribution function; the nearest neighbour distribution function and Ripley's K-function for each type of point separately (centroids and triple points), plus the corresponding three versions of these functions in the bivariate case. A control sample with similar age and cell density and no known abnormality is associated to each patient. The above descriptors are calculated for the patient and the controls. Each descriptive of the patient is compared with the corresponding descriptors from the controls by means of a graphical analysis and a formal test. Some patients presenting different pathologies are analysed in detail. Endothelia considered morphologically abnormal by visual inspection, which were not detected by hexagonality or density analysis, could be distinguished from control endothelia by these new descriptors.

On ophthalmological examination of the index patient, a dense cataract and complete retinal detachment could be detected on the right eye. On the left eye, an absent lens nucleus was found, but no retinal detachment. On radiological examination, there was generalized moderate osteoporosis; the spine showed marked platyspondyly and the bone age was advanced. On laboratory investigations, a normal excretion of amino acids, mucopolysaccharides and oligosaccharides could be found. The phenotypical spectrum observed in the 6 affected individuals was rather uniform. The karyotype was normal in all affected children.

The shortterm results have been well studied in adults, but long-term outcomes are not known. No good studies exist to tell us whether the pediatric eye responds the same as the adult eye to these techniques, but there is reason to believe that the pediatric eye will have many differences, both short- and long-term based on other similar surgeries adapted for pediatrics. These techniques have great potential to add to our armamentarium of treatments for frustrating problems such as unilateral high myopia with amblyopia, but they should be used with caution. The patients who are the most attractive to refractive surgeons, namely, teenagers with typical myopia who want to discard their spectacles, are the patients with potentially the most to lose from a procedure with unknown long-term results for a condition easily treated with other modalities. Those who need it most, namely infants and children with high anisometropia who cannot tolerate contact lenses or spectacles, are the least cooperative, the most difficult to treat postoperatively, and the least able to afford expensive treatments not covered by insurance, are therefore the least likely to be offered the procedure, or to have a study designed to evaluate their specific needs and concerns.

The aim of the study was (1) to determine the need for spectacles in children in Southern India with coloboma, microphthalmos and microcornea, (2) to describe their refractive errors and (3) to assess their needs for low vision aids (LVAs). Methods. Children with congenital eye anomalies were recruited from special education for the blind, schools for the mentally handicapped, community-based rehabilitation programmes and hospital records in Andhra Pradesh, India. All those with at least light perception vision (PL) in one eye and who had navigational vision were refracted. Those whose distance vision in their better eye improved with refraction were prescribed spectacles. Those unable to read N10 were assessed for LVAs for near. Those with distance visual acuity of < 6/18 in the better eye were assessed for telescopes to aid distance vision. Results. Ninety-nine children with coloboma, microcornea or microphthalmos had functional vision. Eight unilateral cases were excluded. Ninety-one bilateral cases were refracted and assessed for LVAs. The vision in 52 children (57%) improved in the better-seeing eye by 1 or more lines of Snellen acuity with spectacles. Spectacles were prescribed most frequently for myopia associated with choroidal coloboma. After refraction, all 19 children with a visual acuity of 6/18 or better could read N10, and 43 of the 72 children (60%) with a visual acuity of < 6/18 to PL with functional vision could read N10 unaided, or with distance correction. A further 6 (8%) reached this level with magnifiers. Thirteen children (18%) were given telescopes. Conclusion. Children with congenital anomalies of the eye and functional vision benefit from refraction and low vision services.","Child; Coloboma; Low vision aid; Microphthalmos; Refraction","adolescent; article; blindness; child; childhood disease; choroid disease; coloboma; cornea disease; eye malformation; eye refraction; female; health care need; human; India; light; major clinical study; male; medical record; mental deficiency; microphthalmia; ophthalmology; reading; refraction error; rehabilitation; spectacles; vision; visual acuity; visual aid","British Council for Prevention of Blindness, BCPB

Methods: Each patient underwent complete ophthalmologic examination, fundus photography, ocular motor recordings (OMR), visual evoked potentials (VEP), visual field testing (VFT), and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the optic pathways. Results: Reduced vision, strabismus, optic nerve dysplasia, congenital nystagmus (CN), and see-saw nystagmus were present in all patients. One of these four patients had congenital hydrocephalus and three of the four patients had amblyopia. Monocular VFT was full in the older patients tested. OMR showed dysconjugate vertical, multiplanar ocular oscillations with CN slow phases, well-developed foveation periods, and occasional spontaneous uniocular saccades. VEPs showed crossed asymmetry and increased latency consistent with uncrossed optic pathways and optic nerve dysplasia. Specific MRI studies showed no chiasm in three patients and a hypoplastic chiasm in one. Conclusions: These patients further elucidate the spectrum of human achiasma/hypochiasma. Careful intraocular and ocular motor evaluation found optic nerve anomalies and see-saw nystagmus in all patients. Patients with congenital optic nerve hypoplasia/dysplasia with or without other midline neurologic defects should be carefully evaluated for the clinical presence of see-saw nystagmus (SSN). The occurrence of the conditions CN, SSN, and optic nerve anomaly strongly suggests achiasma/hypochiasma.

Exon 5 of the gene coding for TIMP-3 was amplified by the polymerase chain reaction, single strand conformation polymorphism analysis undertaken and exon 5 amplicons were directly sequenced. Results - Onset of symptoms was in the third to fourth decade. Five of six eyes had geographic macular atrophy rather than neovascularisation as a cause for central visual loss. Peripheral retinal pigmentary disturbances were present. Scotopic ERGs were abnormal in all three. Mutation analysis showed a G→T transversion in all three resulting in a premature termination codon, E139X, deleting most of the carboxy terminal domain of TIMP-3.

Material and Methods: Sixty-five adults, 52 females and 13 males, with a history of active JCA had a complete ophthalmic evaluation including subjective refractioning on average 26.4 years after JCA onset. The age range was 22-49 years. Results: The refraction ranged from -8.12 D to +6.5 D with a mean (SD) of -0.64 (2.16) D. The mean refraction in the JCA group was significantly more towards myopia than that of a coeval adult hospital-based sample used as controls (p=0.008). Twenty-eight out of the 65 (43%) had a negative refractive value of at least 0.37 D. Myopia onset age ranged from 8 to 31 years. In those able to specify their myopia onset by first purchase of spectacles (n=25) the JCA onset had preceded the myopia, with a mean (SD) interval of 10.1 (5.4) years. Conclusion: The elevated myopia figure of 43% among JCA patients suggests an association between myopia and JCA.

Methods: Software companies shipping an EMR package were contacted to obtain information on their software and company demographics. The focus was on companies selectively marketing to ophthalmology practices, and, therefore, most were selected based on their representation at the 1998 and/or 1999 American Academy of Ophthalmology meeting. Software companies that responded to repeated inquiries in a timely fashion were included. Results: Sixteen companies were evaluated. Electronic medical records packages ranged from $3000 to $80000 (mean, approximately $30000). Company demographics revealed a range from 1 to 1600 employees (mean, 204).

Reading rate has been the main performance measure in studies that have compared reading with large print and optical magnifiers; eye movement characteristics have not been considered. We compared both eye movement characteristics and reading rates for subjects with macular disease reading without and with a range of low-vision devices. Methods. Silent reading rate and eye movement characteristics for text passages at critical print size of 21 subjects aged 14 to 88 years with macular disease were measured with and without their preferred low-vision device. Saccadic frequency was determined from a sequencing task comprising five letters each separated by 5°. Eye movements were recorded using an infrared limbal reflection system. Results. There were no significant differences in reading rate, fixation durations, saccade numbers per word, or percent retrace time when using a low-vision device compared with reading without a low-vision device. The percentage of regressions was, however, lower with the low-vision device. Saccadic frequency in the sequencing task was predictive of reading performance with and without a low-vision device. Conclusions. When reading at critical print size, in terms of reading rate or saccades per word, there was no advantage to using large print over an optical low-vision device.","Age; Eye movements; Macular disease; Magnifiers; Reading","Disease control; Eye movements; Optical instruments; Optical magnifiers; Ophthalmology; adult; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; eye fixation; eye movement; human; priority journal; reading; retina macula degeneration; saccadic eye movement; task performance; visual disorder; visual field",,"Bowers, A.R.; Department of Vision Sciences, Glasgow Caledonian University, Cowcaddens Rd., Glasgow G4 0BA, United Kingdom; email: a.bowers@gcal.ac.uk","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11384010",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035002103

It has been suggested that over-reliance on the cup-to-disc ratio is a major factor in the misinterpretation of the optic disc. In spite of this optometrist assessment of the optic disc tends to be restricted to measurement of the cup-to-disc ratio and cup depth only. Would interpretation of the disc improve if optometrists were to evaluate other parameters? The aim of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of optometrist assessment of nine parameters of the optic nerve head using direct ophthalmoscopy. Methods. Eight optometrists evaluated nine parameters of the optic nerve head (vertical disc diameter, vertical cup-to-disc ratio, neuroretinal rim configuration, cup shape, neuroretinal rim colour, vessel path, presence/ absence of haemorrhage, extent and location of peripapillary atrophy and classification of health status of the disc) in 50 eyes of 50 patients using direct ophthalmoscopy. Intensive training in optic nerve head assessment was given prior to assessing the patients. Criteria for evaluation were discussed. The 'gold standard' reference was the classification of the parameters by a consultant ophthalmologist with a special interest in glaucoma. Results. Interobserver agreement for vertical cup-to-disc ratio was almost perfect (mean weighted kappa 0.84). Agreement for neuroretinal rim configuration, cup shape, haemorrhage and final classification of the disc was good (mean kappa 0.62-0.67). There was moderate agreement for vessel configuration (mean kappa 0.53). For assessment of peripapillary atrophy, disc size and neuroretinal rim colour, agreement was fair (mean kappa 0.22-0.34). Conclusions. Accuracy of assessment was greatest for vertical cup-to-disc ratio, neuroretinal rim configuration and cup shape. Improved agreement has been demonstrated for the final classification of the disc compared with previous reports. The combination of training and assessment of additional disc parameters appears to improve interpretation of the optic nerve head by optometrists.","Direct ophthalmoscopy; Disc parameters; Glaucoma; Optometrist","article; atrophy; classification; controlled study; device; diagnostic accuracy; evaluation; glaucoma; health status; human; intraocular hemorrhage; major clinical study; measurement; ophthalmology; ophthalmoscope; ophthalmoscopy; optic disk; optic disk cup; optic nerve; optometry; parameter; retina; retina blood vessel; standard; training","International Glaucoma Association","Murdoch, I.; Dept. of Preventive Ophthalmology, Institute of Ophthalmology, Bath Street, London EC1V 9EL, United Kingdom; email: i.murdoch@ucl.ac.uk","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11450721",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034949793

To show the clinical features of a case of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia in which the diagnosis was prompted by ophthalmologic examination. Methods. A retrospective case review of a 56-year-old East Indian woman whose presentation to the eye clinic with a history of bloody tears and conjunctival vascular malformations prompted a systemic evaluation that resulted in the diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia. Results. The diagnosis of hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia was eventually confirmed by gastrointestinal endoscopy and otorhinolaryngologic examination. Conclusion. Although hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia is typically diagnosed on the basis of gastrointestinal and otorhinolaryngologic history and examination, the ophthalmologic features of this case were striking enough to arouse suspicion of this disease.","Bloody tears; Conjunctival vascular malformation; Hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia","adult; article; autosomal dominant disorder; case report; clinical feature; conjunctiva disease; female; gastrointestinal endoscopy; human; physical examination; priority journal; Rendu Osler Weber disease; retrospective study; Blood Vessels; Conjunctiva; Diagnosis, Differential; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Female; Humans; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Telangiectasia, Hereditary Hemorrhagic",,"Soong, H.K.; W.K.

This study sought to define eye injury patterns in the U.S. armed forces. Method: Data on patterns of eye injury in the armed forces were obtained through voluntary reporting by U.S. military ophthalmologists throughout the world. The reporting format was standardized with the U.S. Eye Injury Registry initial and follow-up report forms. The data were analyzed for significant injury patterns. Results: Data on 112 patients were submitted, representing a broad range of the military population. Data on a total of 96 patients with a 6-month follow-up were analyzed in this study. Immediately after injury, 43% of the patients were noted to have poor vision (worse than 20/200). After treatment, only 20% were noted to have poor vision. Patients lost an average of 21.6 days of work after a severe eye injury. Conclusion: An eye injury is a traumatic and potentially debilitating event.

To determine whether pharmacological mydriasis leads to a significant difference in interobserver agreement of optic disc measurement compared with examination without mydriasis. Method. A cross sectional study was performed with a pair of observers examining the optic disc of two randomised groups of patients, one group before diagnostic mydriasis, and the other afterwards. Horizontal and vertical disc diameters and cup/disc ratios were measured with a 78 dioptre lens. The study was repeated with another observer pair and two further groups of patients. Results. In study A 86 subjects were examined in total (52 without and 34 with mydriasis). In study B 87 subjects were examined (45 without and 42 with mydriasis). The 95% limits of agreement of the cup/disc ratio measurement differences were significantly larger without mydriasis (p < 0.001 for all studies (F test)). For both studies examination after mydriasis gave significantly greater agreement for vertical and horizontal cup/disc ratios. The cases with good agreement (0.1 difference or better) for vertical cup/disc ratios were 37/52 (72%) and 34/45 (76%) without mydriasis and 33/34 (97%) and 40/42 (95%) respectively with mydriasis. Similar differences were recorded for horizontal cup/disc ratios. Disc diameter measurement results showed similar differences in study A but were not affected by mydriasis in study B. Conclusions. Examination of the optic disc without pharmacological mydriasis gives significantly poorer interobserver agreement. In this study, the mean 95% limits of agreement values for all cup/disc ratio values were 0.27 for examination without mydriasis and 0.13 for examination with mydriasis. A measure outside these limits would suggest a real difference.

Cyclopegia was achieved using two drops of tropicamide 1%, and retinoscopy was performed after residual accommodation had decreased to <2 D. In general, there were no statistically significant differences in IOP between the less myopic and more myopic eyes.Background: There is evidence that intraocular pressure (IOP) is higher in myopes than in hyperopes or emmetropes, and it has been suggested that myopia may be the result of a high IOP. We studied IOP in the two eyes of anisometropes, thus controlling for nuisance variables affecting IOP measurement. Methods: Sixty-seven Chinese children, aged between 8 and 14 years, with anisometropia not <2 D were studied. A Topcon CT-60 noncontact tonometer was used for IOP measurement. Cycloplegia was achieved using two drops of tropicamide 1%, and retinoscopy was performed after residual accommodation had decreased to <2 D. A-scan ultrasonography was carried out using a Storz Alpha ll Biometric Ruler. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in IOP between file less myopic and more myopic eyes.

This disorder is frequently associated with rheumatoid arthritis, systemic vasculitis, connective tissue diseases, and/or hematologic disorders. RPC afflicts patients with recurrent and often progressive episodes of inflammation with the potential for destruction of the affected structures. Tissues involved include the ears, joints, nose, larynx, trachea, eyes, heart valves, kidneys, and skin. Ocular manifestations commonly include episcleritis, scleritis, conjunctivitis, iridocyclitis, chorioretinitis, and proptosis. Lid edema, orbital inflammation, muscle palsies, and corneal melting may also occur. Case report: An 83-year-old man previously diagnosed with RPC presented to our clinic with acute unilateral chemosis, conjunctivitis, lid edema, proptosis, and extraocular muscle restriction. After orbital cellulitis was ruled out, further evaluation revealed posterior scleritis with choroidal detachment OS. A course of oral indomethacin and topical antibiotic-steroid combination drops was implemented in the treatment of the ocular manifestations. The quick positive response to the anti-inflammatory agents confirmed the diagnosis of ocular complications secondary to RPC. Discussion: The presenting ocular signs and symptoms of RPC often resemble other commonly encountered ocular conditions. It is important for the eye care practitioner to be familiar with the ocular manifestations of RPC because the eyes are sometimes the initial site of involvement and may be a marker of severity. Early diagnosis and intervention may significantly improve the patient's outcome. This case report with literature review will hopefully bring to light features of this disease which will help the eye care practitioner in the diagnosis and management of this condition.Background: Relapsing polychondritis (RPC) is a rare, chronic, and potentially fatal multisystemic inflammatory disorder targeting cartilaginous structures.

Methods: A survey was sent to all practising ophthalmologists in Queensland (100). Results: Eighty-seven of the 100 ophthalmologists undertook pterygium surgery with no change in indications for removal, grading or anaesthesia compared to 10 years ago. Nearly half of the ophthalmologists varied their surgical technique from eight commonly used methods according to the individual patient. More than half the respondents used a swinging conjunctival flap and 29% used simple excision leaving the area bare for primary pterygia, although nearly one-quarter of the ophthalmologists added adjunctive therapies such as beta irradiation or mitomycin. For recurrent pterygia, one-third of ophthalmologists preferred adjunctive therapies, and 57% used an autoconjunctival transplant. Conclusion: There has been no consistent trend in surgical removal of pterygia with a significant number of primary pterygia still removed using bare scleral closure.","Autoconjunctival graft; Beta irradiation; Pterygium; Queensland; Survey","mitomycin; anesthesia induction; article; Australia; beta radiation; comparative study; controlled study; eye surgery; follow up; health survey; human; major clinical study; medical practice; ophthalmology; pterygium; sclerotomy; surgical technique; surgical training; tissue flap; Anesthesia, Local; Chemotherapy, Adjuvant; Conjunctiva; Health Surveys; Humans; Mitomycin; Ophthalmology; Physician's Practice Patterns; Pterygium; Queensland; Radiotherapy, Adjuvant; Recurrence; Societies, Medical; Transplantation, Autologous",,"Hirst, L.; Division of Ophthalmology, Department of Surgery, University of Queensland, Ipswich Road, Woolloongabba, QLD 4012, Australia; email: lawrie.hirst@pbf.org.au",,"11720153",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034762107

As the cost and degree of training necessary to provide state of the art health care has increased throughout the world, the present challenge in health care is to establish institutions that are financially sound and responsive to the dynamic needs of the communities in which they exist. As public funds have diminished, the role of the private sector in establishing innovative health care institutions has increased. Setting and study participants. This paper reviews the case of the LV Prasad Eye Institute (LVPEI), an ophthalmologic institute in Hyderabad, India, that is financially sound and medically vital. With an annual budget of US$3 million, 180 000 patients are seen and 23 000 surgeries are performed at the Institute and its satellites each year. Main Measures. The Institute provides patient care at a ratio of 1:1 non-paying to paying patients through fee cross-subsidization. The Institute uses a combination of financial modalities, including donations, grants and fees to administer its non-patient care programs. Non-clinical programs of the Institute include a paramedical training program and a fellowship in ophthalmology, an internationally accredited eye bank for the preservation of corneal tissues, a rural out-reach and education program, a basic science and epidemiology program that directs health policy activities of the Institute and a rehabilitation program for patients with incurable visual deficits. To evaluate its effectiveness, LVPEI uses quality improvement measures, including patient surveys, post-operative outcomes studies and service utilization reviews. Conclusion. This case report of a privately-funded medical institution describes a successful model through which high-quality, equitable health care can be provided in a developing country. The LVPEI's active program of quality management, its academic commitment and programmatic relevance to the needs of its community should be modularized and replicated to establish equitable, efficient and effective health care institutions in the developing world.","Delivery of health care; Education; Eye diseases; Hospitals; India; Medical; Quality of health care; Rural health services; Voluntary","article; budget; case report; cornea preservation; cost; developing country; epidemiology; eye surgery; eyebank; financial management; health care cost; health care policy; health care quality; health center; health education; health program; health survey; human; India; medical education; model; ophthalmology; organization and management; paramedical education; patient care; postoperative period; priority journal; public health service; rehabilitation medicine; review; rural area; social work; staff training; total quality management; treatment outcome; visual disorder; Budgets; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Eye Diseases; Financial Management; Hospitals, Special; Humans; India; Models, Organizational; Ophthalmology; Organizational Case Studies; Organizational Culture; Private Sector; Social Justice; Total Quality Management",,"Samandari, R.; Dept. of Ambulatory Care/Prevention, Harvard Pilgrim Health Care, 133 Brookline Ave., Boston, MA 02215, United States",,"11560347",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034875397

However, this representation has been shown not to be the most suitable one for performing statistical analysis. Although alternative analytical and graphic methods to represent this kind of data have been developed, these formalisms have often gone unnoticed by researchers, despite their usefulness and versatility. Besides, there has been no discussion of how each of them fits in with a particular type of study. In this paper, several mathematical representations of dioptric power are revisited in a comprehensive way. The aim is to encourage researchers in ophthalmology and optometry to use these formalisms in their epidemiological studies, thus profiting from their exactitude and simplicity. Consequently, the emphasis is not on complicated mathematical derivations but on how to use these representations. Their potential and suitability in different applications is analyzed in detail. In addition, some examples are presented to illustrate the mathematical methods considered.","Astigmatism; Dioptric power matrix; Refractive errors; Statistical analysis","article; astigmatism; human; mathematical analysis; mathematical computing; measurement; ophthalmology; optics; optometry; priority journal; refraction error; statistical analysis; Astigmatism; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Humans; Mathematics; Models, Statistical; Optics; Refraction, Ocular","Generalitat Valenciana

PATIENTS AND METHODS: We conducted a retrospective analysis of complications and visual outcomes for 534 phacoemulsification procedures done by third-year residents over a five-year period (June 1992-July 1997) at the department of ophthalmology, University of Chicago. Ail cases were completed using a TCC or SST incision. RESULTS: There was vitreous loss in 6.0% of 348 eyes with TCC incisions and in 11.8% of 186 eyes with SST incisions (P < 0.02). Posterior capsule breaks occurred in 11.5% of the TCC group versus 17.7% in the SST group (P < 0.0453). Best corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better was achieved in 82.5% of all eyes with TCC incisions and in 75.3% of all eyes with SST incisions (P < 0.05). When 151 patients with previous ophthalmic conditions were excluded, the difference in BCVA between the two groups was not statistically significant.

We investigated the electroretinogram and explored the possibility of a metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 mutation in six family members spanning four generations. METHODS: Case report and family study: Complete eye examinations and Ganzfeld electroretinograms were recorded from the maternal great-grandmother, maternal grandmother, mother, uncle, and sibling of the 7-month-old female proband. The electroretinogram was repeated in the proband at 17 months of age. Dark adaptometry was performed in all adult subjects. Fundus photographs and visual field examinations were administered to the grandmother and mother. The metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 gene was amplified and sequenced in all affected subjects. RESULTS: The proband had a negative electroretinogram and a normal fundus. The maternal grandmother, uncle, and mother had an abnormal electroretinogram identical to the proband yet had no visual complaints. The ophthalmology examinations in the adult subjects were normal, and subsequent examination of the proband at 17 months, 5 years, and 6.5 years of age showed no changes in the fundus or refractive error. Her nystagmus resolved by 5 years of age. Rod threshold and visual fields were normal in the affected adult subjects. No mutation in the metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 gene was found. CONCLUSIONS: In this family, a negative electroretinogram was not associated with decreased rod threshold, visual acuity loss, visual field loss, muscle disease, or metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype 6 mutation. Additional study will be required to understand the nature of the negative electroretinogram phenotype in this family.

For purposes of analysis, the clinical representations need first to be transformed into representations in dioptric power space. It turns out, however, that characteristics of the clinical measurements carried over into dioptric power space can be a source of spurious conclusions reached in such studies. The source of the problem lies in the nature of sphere, cylinder, and axis and in the discreteness (multiples of 0.25 D, usually, in sphere and cylinder and 1 or 5° in axis) of the clinical measurements. As a consequence, scatter plots of clinical measurements in dioptric power space may show patterns and structures, including clusters, arcs, and moiré effects. All the structures are artifacts of the discreteness in sphere, cylinder, and axis; they have no other physical basis. Furthermore, the clinical measurements can show departures from normality that are also purely artifact. By learning to recognize artifact in the scatter plots, the researcher can overcome some of the problems. But because of the assumption of normality underlying many statistical procedures, the problem of distortions in the distributions remains. The distortions may weaken the confidence with which inferences can be made or even lead to erroneous conclusions. The purpose of this paper is to draw attention to the problems of artifact in analyses of clinical data and to suggest ways of overcoming it or avoiding it at least in part.","Antistigmatism; Artifact; Astigmatism; Dioptric power matrix; Dioptric power space; Matrices; Stigmatism","Data reduction; Ophthalmology; Optometers; Statistical methods; Dioptric power space; Vision; article; artifact; astigmatism; data analysis; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic procedure; human; measurement; priority journal; quantitative diagnosis",,"Harris, W.F.; Optometric Science Research Group, Department of Optometry, Rand Afrikaans University, PO Box 524, Auckland Park 2006, South Africa; email: wfh@na.rau.ac.za","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11763258",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035181150

To measure delay before treatment of uveal melanoma. Methods. A retrospective study was carried out of patients referred for diagnosis and treatment of uveal melanoma at the Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre (LOOC), a tertiary adult ocular oncology service. Participants were patients with uveal melanoma presenting to an optometrist or general practitioner in the United Kingdom between 1997 and 2000. Main outcome measures were delay at each stage of the referral process according to route of referral and tumour size. Results. Delays greater than 2 weeks occurred (1) between presentation to the optometrist or general practitioner and the ophthalmologist's examination in 50% of patients; (2) between the ophthalmologist's examination and receipt of the referral at the ocular oncology centre in 34%; (3) between receipt of referral at the oncology centre and first assessment at that centre in 16%; and (4) between first assessment at the oncology centre and treatment in 8%. The waiting time for the ophthalmologist's examination was greater if the optometrist referred the patient via the general practitioner instead of directly. The median overall delays between presentation and treatment were 129 days for small tumours, 50 days for medium-sized tumours and 34 days for large tumours. Conclusions. Many patients with uveal melanoma experience long delays before treatment. Patients wait longer to see an ophthalmologist if their tumour is small or if they are referred by the optometrist to the general practitioner instead of directly to the ophthalmologist. Several patients also experience long delays after seeing the ophthalmologist, some having a large tumour by the time of treatment.","Adult; Analysis; Diagnosis; Eye neoplasms; Human; Melanoma; Patients; Therapy; Time","adult; aged; article; cancer center; consultation; controlled study; female; general practitioner; human; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology; optometry; outcomes research; patient referral; retrospective study; time; tumor growth; tumor volume; United Kingdom; uvea melanoma; waiting time",,"Damato, B.; Liverpool Ocular Oncology Centre, Royal Liverpool University Hospital, Prescot Street, Liverpool L7 8XP, United Kingdom; email: Bertil.Damato@btinternet.com","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11339581",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035027621

To examine a large family with an autosomal dominant fundus dystrophy and to investigate whether or not mutations in TIMP-3 gene were involved. Methods. A large family of 58 individuals with an autosomal dominant fundus dystrophy was examined ophthalmologically. A DNA linkage analysis in the 22q12.1-q13.2 region was performed. The TIMP-3 gene was screened for mutations in all five exons. Results. In this large family 15 individuals were affected. All other individuals were found to be clinically unaffected. Pisciform flecks in the midperiphery and drusen-like deposits were the most typical ophthalmological finding in this family and were encountered from the fifth decade on. Chorioretinal atrophy and neovascularisation with disciform lesions characterised the disease from the sixth decade on. Linkage analysis using an affected only analysis, showed a maximum positive lod score of 3.94 at θ = 0.0 with marker D22S283. No mutations possibly causing Sorsby fundus dystrophy were found in either the exonic sequences, the promotor region, or the 3'UTR. Conclusion. The family in this pedigree has an autosomal dominant fundus dystrophy, which is most probably Sorsby fundus dystrophy. Although, in the linkage analysis, significant positive lod scores were found with the region 22q12.1-q13.2, no causative mutations could be identified in the TIMP-3 gene.",,"tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3; adult; aged; article; autosomal dominant inheritance; chorioretinopathy; chromosome 22q; clinical article; drusen; female; gene mutation; genetic linkage; human; male; ophthalmology; priority journal; retina dystrophy; retina neovascularization; sorsby fundus dystrophy; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Atrophy; Chromosome Mapping; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22; DNA; Exons; Female; Genes, Dominant; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Pedigree; Polymerase Chain Reaction; Promoter Regions (Genetics); Retinal Drusen; Retinal Neovascularization; Tissue Inhibitor of Metalloproteinase-3",,"Meire, F.; Department of Ophthalmology, University Hospital of Ghent, De Pintelaan 185, B 9000 Ghent, Belgium; email: francoise.meire@rug.ac.be",,"10873973",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033916986

To assess whether loss of image resolution or colour and subsequent telemedicine transmission of digital images affects the accuracy of retinal lesion detection by ophthalmologists when compared with the original transparencies. Methods. Fifteen ophthalmologists of different experience independently scored 11 retinal images for pathological signs. The images were presented as either transparencies or colour and monochrome digital images, which had been transmitted via telephone lines to a geographically remote location. One patient's eye was also imaged using scanning laser ophthalmosocopy (SLO) which produced a dynamic black and white digital image. ANOVA analysis was performed. Results. Total scores were higher for transparencies than colour (p = 0.0003) or black and white digital images (p = 0.00006). Expert observers (n = 5) considered separately showed no significant difference of accuracy between transparencies and either colour digital (p = 0.09) or monochrome digital images (p = 0.11). Experts were better than trainees at detecting pathology from less familiar images: total score (p = 0.02), colour digital (p = 0.03), monochrome digital (p = 0.02) and SLO images (p = 0.004). Conclusion. Experienced observers can identify sight-threatening retinal pathology from poorer-resolution digital images that have been transmitted by telemedicine. They can also adapt to viewing less familiar images such as black and white digital or SLO images.","Digital image; Image resolution; Observer accuracy; Retinal lesions; Scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; Telemedicine","article; controlled study; diagnostic accuracy; diagnostic imaging; human; ophthalmology; pathology; retina disease; scanning laser ophthalmoscopy; scoring system; statistical analysis; telecommunication","National Lottery Community Fund","Cook, H.L.; Department of Ophthalmology, Rayne Institute, St Thomas' Hospital, Lambeth Palace Road, London SE1 7EH, United Kingdom; email: HelenLCook@aol.com","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11040901",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033848640

To our knowledge, the rate of ophthalmic findings at autopsy has not been documented previously. Design. - We retrospectively reviewed 277 consecutive autopsies conducted between 1995 and 1999 in which the eyes were removed for examination. Ophthalmic findings were placed in the following categories: I, major findings included those that contributed to the patient's death, would have changed patient management, and/or may have important medical implications for close relatives; II, expected findings after ophthalmologic surgery and minor findings that may have eventually required treatment; and III, incidental findings. Results. - Major findings (category I) were found in 32% of autopsies. Minor findings (category II) and incidental findings (category III) were documented in 62% and 34% of autopsies, respectively. Only 14% of autopsies revealed no ophthalmologic diagnoses. Conclusion. - In our series, postmortem ocular examination revealed a number of important findings, including several heritable and rare conditions. Eighty-six percent of autopsies disclosed at least one pathologic ophthalmologic finding, approximately one third of which demonstrated findings significant enough to have likely required management. Diabetic retinopathy was the most frequent major finding. Malignant melanoma of the choroid was the most commonly found intraocular neoplasm. Chronic uveitis was the most common minor finding.

Unit, Wills Eye Hosp., Thomas Jefferson Univ., 900 Walnut Street, Philadelphia, PA 19107-5598, United States","PURPOSE: If undetected and untreated, diabetic retinopathy can lead to severe vision loss and irreversible blindness, imposing both clinical and economic costs to patients and society. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to determine both the direct and indirect costs of providing ophthalmic, social and rehabilitative services for persons with diabetic eye disease. METHODS: Persons with diabetes and seen by ophthalmologists in the Canadian Province of Nova Scotia were ascertained from provincial health records for the years 1993-1996, inclusive. In addition, utilization data from community and blindness rehabilitation agencies located throughout the Province of Nova Scotia for the same time period were also obtained and analyzed. A cost-of-illness analysis of ophthalmic and additional services for persons with diabetes was then performed using the available data sources. RESULTS: The total cost of direct and indirect ophthalmic, disability and rehabilitative care for persons with diabetes mellitus in Nova Scotia over the study period, 1993-1996, was estimated to be CDN $10,521,816.58. Direct costs amounted to CDN $1,416,355.05 (13.46%), indirect costs due to lost productivity reached CDN $5,072,831.85 (48.22%), rehabilitation services cost CDN $251,204.08 (2.38%), disability payments amounted to CDN $979,992.00 (9.32%), while lost wages due to disability payments measured a further CDN $2,801,433.60 (26.62% of total costs). CONCLUSIONS: Over the period reviewed, ophthalmic costs rose by a factor 3.2 greater than that observed for goods and services captured by the Canadian Consumer Price Index. Further analyses over a longer follow-up period are required to definitively establish whether or not there is a long-term upward trend in ophthalmic costs.","Blindness; Canada; Diabetic retinopathy; Health economics; Nova Scotia","article; blindness; Canada; cost benefit analysis; cost of illness; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; disability; economic aspect; follow up; health care cost; health economics; human; ophthalmology; priority journal; productivity; visual impairment; Adolescent; Blindness; Cost of Illness; Costs and Cost Analysis; Diabetic Retinopathy; Female; Health Care Costs; Humans; Incidence; Male; Nova Scotia; Ophthalmology; Retrospective Studies",,"Smith, A.F.; Med.

A four-generation family with this disorder, including asymptomatic carrier females, was investigated by molecular analysis of the OA1 gene. Methods: DNA samples were available from 22 individuals of this family, including 6 affected males and 6 obligate carriers. The nine exons of the OA1 gene were amplified and further analyzed by SSCP and sequencing. Results: A detailed clinical examination of the index patient and two female carriers showed the typical signs of ocular albinism. Visual evoked potential responses showed markedly asymmetrical responses from the two hemispheres in the affected person as well as in the carriers, as a result of misrouting and decussation of optic nerve fibers. Molecular genetic analysis demonstrated a previously undescribed 29-bp deletion at position 225-253 in exon 1 of the OA1 gene, which segregated in the family. Conclusion: Clinical examination combined with molecular genetic analysis enhances the potential for a precise diagnosis for persons at risk of xlOA and provide an accurate basis for genetic counseling.",,"DNA; adult; article; child; chromosome arm; clinical article; clinical examination; controlled study; DNA determination; exon; family; female; gender; gene amplification; gene deletion; gene mutation; gene sequence; heterozygote; heterozygote detection; human; infant; male; molecular genetics; ocular albinism; ophthalmology; priority journal; sample; single strand conformation polymorphism; symptom; X chromosome; X chromosome linkage; Adult; Albinism, Ocular; Amino Acid Sequence; Base Sequence; Child, Preschool; DNA Mutational Analysis; Electroretinography; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Exons; Female; Fundus Oculi; Heterozygote Detection; Humans; Infant; Linkage (Genetics); Male; Molecular Sequence Data; Ophthalmoscopy; Pedigree; Polymorphism, Single-Stranded Conformational; Sequence Deletion; Visual Acuity; X Chromosome",,"Rudolph, G.; Augenklinik der Univ.

The electrodiagnostic measurements were made using an automated system developed at Christchurch Hospital. The results of these investigations confirmed the clinical value of ophthalmic electrodiagnosis both as an aid in the diagnosis of these young patients and in determining their prognosis. In some cases it permitted an early detection of their condition. In addition the analyses of the ERG into rod and cone mediated responses helped to establish the diagnosis of hereditary retinal disorders and was particularly useful in the case of infants with nystagmoid movements of the eyes who were suspected of having poor vision. Interestingly 21 of the 113 patients were found to have functional visual loss. These patients complained of visual loss but subsequent examinations revealed their ocular findings, EOG, ERG and VER were all normal.

The development of the National GP Eye Skills Workshop was a joint initiative of the Royal Australian Colleges of General Practice and Ophthalmology, to enhance the skills of Australian general practitioners in a range of important ocular examination and procedural areas. Methods: Workshops were run in eight Queensland Divisions of General Practice in 1998. Between two and 10 local ophthalmologists in each divisional area were involved either in the workshop programme or in the recruitment of patients for the patient assessment module. Workshops were run on weekends and included modules on vision testing and disease screening in children and adults, opthalmoscopy, assessment for glaucoma and diabetic retinopathy, incision of chalazions, removal of corneal foreign bodies, ocular first aid, implementing eye assessment in busy general practice, and a patient assessment clinic. A questionnaire was administered which was comprised of sections relating to the format of the workshop, new skills and concepts learnt, learning exceptions, and perception of future ability to treat/scan/assess for eye conditions in general practice. The questionnaire was completed by 91% of participants. Results: Participants strongly supported the impact of the workshop on their ability to detect and treat eye problems in their practices, and refer where appropriate to an ophthalmologist. They also rated highly all individual aspects of the programme in terms of impact on their delivery of general practitioner eye care.

We investigated the presentation and clinical characteristics of ODV and determined the efficacy of systemic corticosteroids in its management. Methods: From 1973 to 1997, we investigated 32 patients (34 eyes) with ODV. The information was obtained by complete medical and ophthalmic history taking and a detailed ophthalmic examination at the initial and follow-up visits. Non-parametric analysis of demographic characteristics and Cox proportional hazard modeling of treatment outcomes was performed. Results: The most common presenting symptom was blurred vision (in 31/34 eyes -91.2%). Visual acuity was 6/12 or better in 82.4% and 6/30 or better in 94.1% of the eyes. All eyes had an enlarged blind spot, vitreous cells and optic disc edema. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated retinal peripapillary phlebitis in 52.6% of the eyes. Systemic hypertension in young patients (P=0.004) and frequency of smoking (P=0.004 for males, P=0.046 for females) were significantly higher than in the general population. Treatment with systemic corticosteroids improved the rate of resolution of optic disc edema and vitreous cells, reducing median resolution times (P=0.042). There was a tendency towards improved central visual fields with treatment (P=0.09). Final visual acuity was 6/12 or better in 25 (92.6%) and 6/18 or better in all of the 27 eyes followed by us. Conclusion: Our study indicates that our cases represent a distinct clinical entity of ODV and not just a potpourri of unilateral optic disc edema of different etiologies. It is a self-limiting disease, usually with good prognosis, and benefits from treatment with systemic corticosteroids. The presence of retinal peripapillary phlebitis on fluorescein angiography suggests mild vasculitis of the optic nerve head as the primary pathological mechanism in this disorder.",,"acetylsalicylic acid; antibiotic agent; antidepressant agent; antihistaminic agent; antihypertensive agent; calcium channel blocking agent; chlorothiazide; corticosteroid; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; dipyridamole; diuretic agent; doxepin; fluoxetine; gemfibrozil; hormone; imipramine; levothyroxine sodium; nonsteroid antiinflammatory agent; oral contraceptive agent; prednisone; ranitidine; adult; aged; anamnesis; article; clinical article; controlled study; corticosteroid therapy; demography; drug efficacy; female; fluorescence angiography; follow up; human; hypertension; male; nonbiological model; ophthalmology; optic disk; pathogenesis; patient information; phlebitis; priority journal; prognosis; retina; smoking; treatment outcome; vasculitis; visual acuity; visual field; visual impairment",,"Hayreh, S.S.; Dept. of Ophthalmology/Visual Sci., University Hospitals and Clinics, 200 Hawkins Drive, Iowa City, IA 52242-1091, United States","Springer Verlag","11011684",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033843159

Methods - Tritan CCS was determined (Moorfields Vision System, CH Electronics) in 15 eyes (14 patients, 75.7 (±6.6) years) with a refractive multifocal IOL (Allergan SA 40N) and in 11 eyes (10 patients, 73.7 (±6.4) years) with a monofocal IOL (Allergan SI 40 NB). Measurements were made monocularly under mesopic conditions at a distance of 2 metres from the monitor with best distance refraction plus 0.5 D at 0.5, 1, 3, 6, 11.4, and 22.8 cycles per degree (cpd). The test was then repeated for the multifocal IOLs, adding minus 2.5 D to the best distance refraction to force the patient to use the near focus. Both lenses were also investigated under glare conditions with the same set-up and using the brightness acuity tester (BAT). Results - The tritan CCS function without glare in multifocal lenses through the distance focus was nearly identical to that through the near focus. The following statistically significant differences were measured: the CCS function without glare for the multifocal lens was worse at 0.5 cpd and 1.0 cpd than that of the monofocal lens. In CCS testing of the multifocal group with glare at 6 cpd, the results through the distance focus were better than the results through the near focus. For the CCS function with glare, the values for the distance focus in the multifocal lens were worse than the values for the monofocal lens at 0.5 cpd and 1 cpd. In CGS testing with glare through the near focus and CCS testing through the monofocal lens, the monofocal lens performed better at 0.5 cpd, 1 cpd, 3 cpd, and 6 cpd. Conclusion - Refractive multifocal intraocular lenses influence tritan CCS function compared to monofocal lenses.",,"adult; aged; article; brightness; clinical article; color; computer system; contrast sensitivity; distance perception; eye refraction; glare; human; lens implant; multifocal lens; priority journal; visual acuity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Color Perception; Contrast Sensitivity; Diagnosis, Computer-Assisted; Fixation, Ocular; Humans; Lenses, Intraocular; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Statistics, Nonparametric; Visual Acuity",,"Pieh, S.; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Vienna, Medical School, Währinger Gürtel 18-20, 1090 Vienna, Austria; email: stefan.pieh@univie.ac.at",,"11423455",Article,"Final",Open Access,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034917654

Between May and September 1998, 197 adult patients were recruited to the study. A questionnaire containing closed-ended questions was completed by nurses after each FFA and a questionnaire was given to patients to complete 5 hours after the procedure at home. Patients' anxiety level was measured before FFA using a 5-item ordinal response scale. Results. Results indicate that patients from black, Asian, Chino-Asian and mixed ethnic origins are significantly more likely to vomit and feel nauseous immediately after the administration of fluorescein dye. Patients with a history of nausea after FFA are significantly more likely to feel nauseous again after repeat FFA. Conclusion.

Ophthalmic data, while different among individuals, are usually similar between fellow eyes of the same individual. This study was designed to illustrate alternative approaches to account for the correlation between fellow eyes. This is important for making inferences using data from both eyes. Methods. With the use of a real data set from a population-based study, we described the distribution of intraocular pressure (IOP) by estimating the mean and standard deviation (SD) and evaluated the potential risk factors of higher IOP based on the regression method. The units of observation studied were of both eyes, right eye only, left eye only, the eyes with higher IOP and the mean value of both eyes. Furthermore, the generalized estimating equation (GEE) method was used to account for the correlation between fellow eyes in the regression analysis. Results and inferences from the different approaches were compared. Results. The analysis included all the eyes, providing the largest sample size and unbiased estimates of the mean and SDs. There were some discrepancies among different approaches in the regression analysis. The GEE method simultaneously evaluated the effects of both eyes, and increased precision and enhanced inferences. Conclusions. Inconsistent results among different ophthalmic studies result from variations in not only study design and courses but also statistical methods. Making the best use of appropriate statistical techniques, which account for between eye correlation, provides valid statistical inferences.","Generalized estimating equation; Intraocular pressure; Linear modeling; Statistics","article; human; intraocular pressure; major clinical study; regression analysis; risk factor; sample; statistics; Blood Pressure; Humans; Intraocular Pressure; Linear Models; Ophthalmology",,"Cheng, C.-Y.; Department of Ophthalmology, Taipei Veterans General Hospital, 201, Section 2, Shih-Pai Road, Taipei 112, Taiwan",,"11195139",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034527479

To evaluate inter- and intra-rater reliability for the interpretation of MTI Photoscreener photographs taken in a population of Native American preschool children with a high prevalence of astigmatism. Methods. Photographs of 369 children were rated by 11 nonexpert and 3 expert raters. Photographs for each child were scored as pass, refer, or retake. Nonexpert raters scored photos on two separate occasions, permitting analysis of intra-rater reliability. Results. Analyses of pass/refer responses only: inter-rater reliability was moderate to substantial among nonexpert raters and substantial among expert raters. Intra-rater reliability among nonexperts was substantial. Analyses of all responses (pass, refer, and retake): inter-rater reliability for pass and refer scores was moderate among nonexperts and substantial among experts; for retake scores inter-rater reliability was slight for nonexperts and moderate for experts. Intra-rater reliability among nonexperts was substantial for pass and refer scores and moderate for retake scores. Conclusions. In this population with a high prevalence of astigmatism, whether MTI photoscreening results are interpretable is much more variable among and within raters than whether an interpretable photograph should be scored as pass or refer.

Methods: The diameter of one pre-selected retinal arteriole per eye was measured using the Retinal Vessel Analyser (RVA), an instrument developed for non-invasive clinical measurement of the diameter of the main retinal vessels. The instrument contains a video system, and the integrated software recognises the boundaries of the retinal vessels by detecting their light-transmission profile. The vessel diameter (in arbitrary units) is plotted against time (seconds) on a separate display screen. In Study I the vessel diameter was measured in 12 eyes of six healthy volunteers (age 21-26 years, mean age 24.0 years) on six occasions each separated by 14 days. In a double-masked fashion, each subject's right eye was treated with one of 5 glaucoma medications (brinzolamide 1%, timolol 0.5%, betaxolol 0.5%, brimonidine 0.2% or latanoprost 0.005%) and the left eye always received balanced salt solution. In Study II, one randomly selected eye of 16 patients (age 50-79 years, mean age 65.2 years) suffering from primary open-angle glaucoma controlled with topical monotherapy was investigated, in an unmasked fashion. Four patients were on betaxolol 0.5% treatment, six subjects were receiving non-selective topical beta receptor blockers and six subjects were being treated with once daily latanoprost 0.005%. Results: The coefficient of variation for the arteriole diameter in the healthy volunteers was less than 12% in each case. No significant post-treatment change of the diameter of the pre-selected arteriole was found for any topical medication investigated, either in the healthy volunteers (Study I) or in the patients suffering from glaucoma (Study II) (p>0.05, paired t-test). In addition, in Study I no difference was observed in the alteration of the arteriole diameter between the baseline and the hour 2 measurements when the values from the drug-treated and placebo treated eyes were compared (p<0.05, two-way ANOVA). Conclusion: In the present investigations it was not possible to detect any statistically meaningful change of the arteriole diameter at two hours after the instillation of any of several topical antiglaucoma drugs widely used in clinical practice. Further investigations are necessary to clarify whether the lack of observed change is due to the lack of retinal vascular effects of the drugs investigated, or is due to an inability of the RVA instrument in practice to detect alterations between time-points separated by several hours.","Glaucoma; Retinal arterioles; Retinal vessel analyser; Topical glaucoma medication","antiglaucoma agent; beta adrenergic receptor blocking agent; betaxolol; brimonidine; brinzolamide; latanoprost; placebo; timolol; adult; aged; arteriole; article; blood vessel diameter; clinical article; clinical trial; computer program; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; device; drug effect; human; in vivo study; intraocular pressure; medical instrumentation; open angle glaucoma; pilot study; retina blood flow; retina blood vessel; vasoconstriction; vasodilatation; videorecording; Adrenergic alpha-Antagonists; Adrenergic beta-Antagonists; Adult; Aged; Antihypertensive Agents; Arterioles; Betaxolol; Carbonic Anhydrase Inhibitors; Glaucoma; Humans; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Pilot Projects; Prostaglandins F, Synthetic; Quinoxalines; Retinal Artery; Sulfonamides; Thiazines; Timolol",,"Kóthy, P.; 1st Department of Ophthalmology, Semmelweis University, Tömö u. 25-29, H-1083 Budapest, Hungary; email: kotpet@szeml.sote.hu",,"12162586",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0344986468

Ophthalmological examinations revealed granulomatous iridocyclitis in her left eye and retinal periphlebitis in both eyes. The diagnosis of tuberculosis was suspected because of a positive tuberculin skin test. However, a further examination by an anti-LAM-B antibody test excluded active tuberculosis.

Forty-five subjects with normal vision and binocular function underwent vertical vergence training for a week. Training was done using a vertical prism bar, and the vertical fixation disparity was measured using the Disparometer. In general, vertical prism bar training provided a long-term effect, both increasing the vertical fusional amplitude and flattening the slope of the VFD curve.Background: The vertical forced vergence fixation disparity (VFD) curve represents the amount of vertical fixation disparity, the steady-state vertical bifixation error of the eyes, at various levels of vertical vergence demand. The main aim of the present study was to examine the effects of vertical vergence training on the slope of the VFD curve in a normal, young adult population. Methods: Forty-five subjects with normal vision and binocular function underwent vertical vergence training for 1 week. The training was done using a vertical prism bar, and the vertical fixation disparity was measured using the Disparometer. Results: The mean slope of the VFD curve in a normal, young adult population was 1.103 min arc/δ. The slope of the VFD curve decreased significantly after the training and remained flattened for at least 3 months. There was no evidence to support the idea that the decrease in the VFD slope was related to the increase of vertical fusional amplitude. Conclusions: Vertical prism bar training provided a long-term effect, both increasing the vertical fusional amplitude and flattening the slope of the VFD curve.

Methods: A pneumatic suction ring was applied to the eye in cats while the IOP was monitored. Three groups of animals (10 per group) were used. A vacuum pressure of 450 mbar was applied in one step to eyes of group 1 (anesthetized) and to group 2 (euthanized) cats. In group 3 (anesthetized) cats, an initial vacuum pressure of 250 mbar was applied, followed by a vacuum of slowly increasing pressure at a rate of 5 mbar/min for a total of 40 min to 450 mbar. Results: After the one-step application of a vacuum (450 mbar) to the eyes of anesthetized cats (group 1), IOP peaked within the first minute from a basal value of 25 ± 2 mm Hg (mean ± SD) to 90 ± 7 mm Hg. It then rapidly decreased to 69 ± 2 mm Hg 5 min later and continued to decrease to 39 ± 4 mm Hg 40 min later. This sharp peak and decline of IOP were also observed in eyes of euthanized cats (group 2). The basal IOP of these eyes was 8 ± 1 mm Hg. It rose to 18 ± 2 mm Hg immediately after the application of vacuum pressure (450 mbar) and returned to the basal level 5 min later. In contrast, the eyes of group 3 receiving an initial vacuum of 250 mbar followed by a 5 mbar/min vacuum increment exhibited a rapid increase in IOP and a very stable plateau (mean IOP = 62-68 mm Hg), lasting the whole study period (40 min). Conclusion: IOP after a one-step application of a vacuum via a pneumatic suction ring is self-adjusting and declines rapidly over time. This decline in IOP can be overcome by a supplementary increment in vacuum pressure. Copyright © 2001 S.

Methods: Eighty-four diabetic patients were included in the study. They were from a consecutive series of patients attending the diabetic eye-screening clinic, with retinopathy at the macula requiring ophthalmology assessment. All patients were subsequently examined in the eye hospital, by ophthalmologist slit lamp biomicroscopy assessment as the gold standard, followed by oral fluorescein angiography. Results: This study indicates a sensitivity of 92% and specificity of 81%. Only 4.8% of patients developed a minor reaction to oral fluorescein; 84.5% of images were of good quality. Conclusions: Oral fluorescein angiography is an efficient and highly sensitive tool for the detection of macular oedema. It can be used as an adjunct in the diabetic screening service to identify patients with oedema within a disc diameter of the macula. Ultimately it will ensure that only necessary and smaller numbers of patients are referred to ophthalmologists.","Diabetic retinopathy; Macular oedema; Oral fluorescein angiography; Screening; Slit lamp biomicroscopy","fluorescein; accuracy; article; controlled study; diabetes mellitus; diabetic retinopathy; drug induced disease; fluorescence angiography; human; image quality; intermethod comparison; major clinical study; ophthalmology; patient referral; retina macula edema; retina macula lutea; screening; slit lamp; standard; Administration, Oral; Contrast Media; Diabetic Retinopathy; Fluorescein; Fluorescein Angiography; Humans; Macular Degeneration; Mass Screening; Sensitivity and Specificity",,"Razvi, F.M.21 Brandling Park, Jesmond, Newcastle upon Tyne NE2 4RR, United Kingdom; email: fgsummerfield@cs.com",,"11903401",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035669666

Design: Historical manuscript. Methods: We review the use of the term in ancient Greek, Roman, and early Byzantine medical literature (5th century BC-7th century AD) and include a quick reference to the theories on its etymology. Results: Physicians of antiquity defined as nyctalopia the symptom of defective dark adaptation, most commonly in the clinical setting of vitamin A deficiency. An alternative definition, the improvement of vision at night, is not recorded before the 2nd century AD and seems to result from a broader interpretation of the word, lacking medical acceptance at that time. Conclusions: We propose to the ophthalmic community the use of the term nyctalopia exclusively for the description of defective dark adaptation. © 2001 by the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",,"article; dark adaptation; Greece; history; human; Italy; medical literature; night blindness; night vision; priority journal; publication; retinol deficiency; symptomatology; Byzantium; Greek World; History, Ancient; History, Medieval; Humans; Medicine in Literature; Night Blindness; Ophthalmology; Roman World; Terminology",,"Brouzas, D.10 G.

The original BDM is an example of a bivariate generalized linear model. In this paper smoothing is introduced on the marginal as well as on the association level. Our non-parametric procedure can be used as a diagnostic tool for identifying parametric transformations of the covariates in the linear BDM, hence it also provides a kind of goodness-of-fit test for a bivariate generalized linear model. Cubic smoothing spline functions for the covariates are estimated by maximizing a penalized version of the log-likelihood. The method is applied to two studies. The first study is the classical Wisconsin Epidemiologic Study of Diabetic Retinopathy. The second study is a twin study, where the association between the elements of twin pairs is of primary interest. The results show that smoothing on the association level can give a significant improvement to the model fit.

Methods: An index approach for the measurement of outcome of cataract surgery is modeled. The index approach uses information about activities and difficulties in daily life as well as visual acuity and age. The change in activities and difficulties after surgery is expressed by changes in distances, and an overall index score is calculated as ratios of values to distances. Values to distances are estimated as solutions to linear programming problems. Index scores are calculated for two groups of patients, those with an ocular co-morbidity and those without. Economic efficiency is also estimated by use of an index approach. In the estimation of efficiency we use the calculated index scores of outcome of surgery as a measure of output of the ophthalmology department. Four different departments providing cataract surgery are compared. Results: The studied departments showed differences to a great extent when traditional measures of cataract surgery outcomes were used. These differences changed when the outcomes were compared by use of index scores. When economic efficiency was calculated the difference between the departments was further reduced and only one department was considered inefficient according to the model. Conclusion: An index approach was used to study outcomes of cataract surgery and economic efficiency in four departments. This approach takes into account the complexity of cost in relation to feasible outcome. The ranking between the departments described by traditional methods turned out differently using the model.","Cataract surgery; Cost-effectiveness; Efficiency; Index","age; article; calculation; cataract extraction; comorbidity; comparative study; controlled study; daily life activity; economic aspect; eye disease; hospital cost; hospital department; human; information; linear system; major clinical study; mathematical model; measurement; ophthalmology; outcomes research; priority journal; scoring system; visual acuity; Cataract Extraction; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Costs and Cost Analysis; Efficiency, Organizational; Health Personnel; Hospital Costs; Hospitals, County; Hospitals, University; Humans; Models, Economic; Ophthalmology; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Surgery Department, Hospital",,"Lundström, M.; Department of Ophthalmology, Blekinge Hospital, S-371 85 Karlskrona, Sweden; email: mats.lundstrom@ltblekinge.se",,"11284752",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035088888

The color discrimination abilities of heterozygous deutan female carriers were measured using color mixture thresholds and compared with those of suspected nonheterozygous normal subjects. Methods. Eight test subjects and 26 control subjects were run on a computer-controlled color test (color mixture thresholds) that presented 1° diameter spots on a color television monitor for 1/60 of a second. A QUEST procedure was used to determine visual thresholds for spots varying in brightness and/or color. Individual data points were graphed on an X/Y plot and fitted with an ellipse. The major and minor diameters of the ellipse represent the color and brightness thresholds, respectively. Results. The mean axis angle of the ellipse for the heterozygous carriers did not differ from that for the controls (15.75° vs. 14.93°, p = 0.428, Mann-Whitney test). The carriers did show, however, a larger mean major axis length (68.79 vs. 46.78, p = 0.0218, Mann-Whitney test). Additionally, the length-to-width ratios for the carriers were higher than the controls (9.34 vs. 6.80, p = 0.0403, Mann-Whitney test). Conclusions. Deutan-carriers do show reduced color purity discrimination as measured using color mixture thresholds compared with nonheterozygous, color vision normals.","Color discrimination; Color mixture threshold; Color vision carriers; Tetrachromatic; X inactivation","Color television; Computer applications; Ophthalmology; Optometers; Deutan carriers; Color vision; article; brightness; clinical article; color discrimination; color vision defect; controlled study; female; heterozygote; human; priority journal",,"Lang, A.; Ohio State University, 338 W. 10th Street, Columbus, OH 43210, United States","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11525549",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034867932

We report percentages and mean values overall and across networks. Logistic regression is used to identify factors associated with clients receiving recommended diabetes care. Within two years, five of the networks recruited 125 providers and collected information on over 8,000 individuals with diabetes. The percentage of enrollees with a glycosylated hemoglobin measure, eye exam, and dietician visit is greater at follow-up than at intake and an intake 'referral' is strongly associated with clients being treated for high blood pressure at follow-up.

The study aims to evaluate the visual acuity results of eyes affected by serous pigment epithelium detachment in age-related macular degeneration, having had indocyanine green-directed laser photocoagulation, and to correlate them to the pattern of serous pigment epithelium detachment on indocyanine green angiography. Methods: Thirty-four eyes of 31 patients affected by serous pigment epithelium detachment in age-related macular degeneration were prospectively considered. Each patient underwent an opthalmological examination including fluorescein and indocyanine green angiography one day before, and 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months, 12 months and 24 months after krypton-laser treatment. The serous pigment epithelium detachment was classified in the late-phases angiograms as either hypofluorescent, isofluorescent or hyperfluorescent comparing the fluorescence of the serous pigment epithelium detachment with the choroidal background fluorescence. Results: The indocyanine green-guided laser treatment was associated with a temporary stabilization and a long-term progressive reduction of visual acuity: after 24 months visual acuity improved in 2.9%, stabilized in 26.5% and worsened in 70.5% of cases. Serous pigment epithelium detachment presenting a pre-treatment hyperfluorescence had a final visual acuity of 0.06, with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation development in 100% of cases, whereas serous pigment epithelium detachment presenting a pretreatment hypofluorescence and isofluorescence showed a final visual acuity of 0.12, with subfoveal choroidal neovascularisation development in 43.5% of eyes, with statistically significant difference. Conclusion: Overall visual acuity decreases with time after indocyanine green-guided laser treatment of choroidal neovascularisation in serous pigment epithelium detachment, and serous pigment epithelium detachment becoming hyperfluorescent in the late-phases of indocyanine green angiography has the worst functional outcome.","Hyperfluorescence; Indocyanine green angiography; Serous retina pigment epithelial detachment","indocyanine green; adult; aged; article; clinical article; controlled study; fluorescence; fluorescence angiography; human; indocyanine green angiography; laser coagulation; ophthalmology; pigment epithelium; priority journal; prospective study; retina detachment; retina macula age related degeneration; subretinal neovascularization; time; visual acuity; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Choroidal Neovascularization; Fluorescein Angiography; Fluorescence; Humans; Indocyanine Green; Laser Coagulation; Macular Degeneration; Middle Aged; Pigment Epithelium of Eye; Prospective Studies; Retinal Detachment; Visual Acuity",,"Battaglia Parodi, M.; Eye Clinic, University of Trieste, Ospedale Maggiore, 34129 Trieste, Italy",,"10990048",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033864315

Setting: Two-page self-administered questionnaire mailed to 622 ophthalmologists listed with the Royal Australian College of Ophthalmologists. Methods: The survey included questions about practice details such as size and location; specialty; current practice with regard to management of patients with diabetes; confidence in screening for diabetic retinopathy; and a number of patient scenarios related to screening, follow-up and treatment of diabetic retinopathy. Results: Of the 577 eligible ophthalmologists, 475 (82%) completed the questionnaire. They had been practicing ophthalmology between 1 and 50 years (median 16 years) and 89 (19%) indicated that they had a subspecialty interest either in vitreo-retinal surgery or in medical retina. For 145 (30.5%) of the ophthalmologists, at least one of their practices was located in a country area. The estimated percentage of patients with diabetes ranged from 0.1 to 60% (mean = 9.9%). Retinal specialists perform between 0 and 750 macular focal photocoagulation procedures per year (mean = 94) compared with a range of 0-350 for non-retinal specialists (mean = 10.3) (t = 6.1, P < 0.001). The ophthalmologists were presented with a hypothetical patient with cataract requiring surgery and clinically significant macular oedema that would be difficult to treat (but not impossible) because of the cataract. Seventy-seven ophthalmologists (16%) said they would delay the macular laser therapy until after the cataract surgery had been performed. In multivariate logistic regression models, non-retinal specialists were 4.44 times as likely to perform the cataract surgery first (95%CL = 1.57, 12.6) and ophthalmologists who had been in practice more than 15 years were 2.50 times as likely to perform cataract surgery first (95%CL = 1.47, 4.26). There were other examples of practice that differed from the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) guidelines in patient scenarios. The majority of ophthalmologists (60%) expressed a moderate or strong need to learn more about the management of diabetic retinopathy. Discussion: The variability in the management of diabetic retinopathy by Australian ophthalmologists and the desire of ophthalmologists to learn more about diabetic retinopathy provide evidence to support the need for the NHMRC Guidelines for Diabetic Retinopathy. These data will be used to evaluate changes in practice as a result of the implementation of the guidelines.","Diabetic retinopathy; Evaluation studies; Health services research; Practice guidelines","article; Australia; clinical practice; diabetic retinopathy; evaluation; health services research; laser surgery; medical decision making; medical specialist; patient care; physician attitude; practice guideline; retina macula edema; screening; Diabetic Retinopathy; Health Services Research; Humans; Laser Coagulation; Ophthalmology; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Practice Guidelines; Questionnaires; Victoria",,"McCarty, C.A.; Centre for Eye Research Australia, 32 Gisborne Street, East Melbourne, Vic. 3002, Australia; email: cathy@cera.unimelb.edu.au",,"10933773",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033926101

Methods: Each subject was tested with LED-hybrid and LED-kinetic perimetry procedures, using a black double-arc perimeter. Targets in both procedures were identical in size, color, luminance, contrast, and flicker rate. However, in the LED- hybrid procedure, peripheral targets were sequentially illuminated from more peripheral to more central locations, whereas in the LED-kinetic procedure, a peripheral target on a black wand was manually moved centrally along the perimeter arm. A subset of subjects was also tested with white sphere kinetic perimetry (WSKP). Results: The LED-kinetic procedure produced larger measured visual field extent than the LED-hybrid procedure in 3.5-, 11 -, 17-, and 30- month-olds, but not in 7-month-olds or adults. Data from subjects tested with WSKP indicated that both stimulus motion and discrepancies in scoring methods contributed to the difference reported previously between visual field measurements obtained with WSKP vs. LED-hybrid perimetry.

The samples for the control group (n= 4) were obtained during routine non-thyroid-related corrective strabismus surgery. Ophthalmological evaluation with clinical activity score (CAS), endocrinological evaluation, and ultrasound were used in our study. Correlation between clinical and histological analyses in connective tissues and extraocular muscles from patients with Graves' ophthalmopathy was done. The echography results disclosed an enlargement in all extraocular recti muscles with the exception of one patient. Periodic acid-Schiff and Giemsa stains revealed a moderate number of mast cells in the endomysial connective tissue, none of which displayed significant degranulation. There were no signs of muscle cell damage. Fifteen of the biopsies showed weak cellular reactions with only scattered inflammatory cells. Furthermore, the inflammatory process may be localized and not equally distributed throughout the muscle. Thus, the biopsies might not be representative for the whole muscle. Statistical significance analysis was found when sex and CAS were compared (p = 0.001683) using the Fisher test.

In 1962, Stuart & Burian noted that, without adopting a standard routine, ""measurements of various patients could not be compared, and there will be considerable difference in measurement from one examination to another and by different examiners"" (1). Diagnostic position gaze angles are not routinely measured. Is this important? Subjects and Methods: Subjects were 82 volunteer experts recruited from attendees at the 1998 American Association for Pediatric Ophthalmology and Strabismus (AAPOS) scientific meeting. One author served as examinee for all testing. The actual head posture was measured for the expert designated primary position, right and left gazes, head tilts and up- and downgazes using the CROM device. The examinee fixated at a six meter distance accommodative target. Examiners were asked to mimic their office routine. Eighty-two subjects ranging from 29 to 69 years of age, consisting of 24 females and 58 males were recruited. Sixty-nine were pediatric ophthalmologists, 7 orthoptists, 4 international members and 2 members in training. Eight subjects also underwent re-testing. Years in practice averaged 11.5. Results: Range of head posture measurements: For ""Horizontal Gaze"": 10 to 50 degrees; For ""Vertical Gaze"": 4 to 58 degrees; For ""Head Tilts"": 20 to 50 degrees. There was no substantial difference between initial and repeat measurements. Conclusion: There is a surprisingly high degree of variability amongst expert observers in defining standard gaze positions. These results may explain some of the inconsistent outcomes noted in the strabismus literature. The implication for transferring data from publication to practice and in designing multicentered protocols is concerning. Without defining and maintaining a standard for binocular alignment measurements, comparison between studies and examiners is not possible.","Binocular alignment; Cervical range of motion device; Comparative; CROM device; Diagnosis; Ocular motility examination; Strabismus; Studies; Tests","adult; article; binocular vision; clinical practice; controlled study; diagnostic procedure; diagnostic test; eye movement; female; gaze; head position; head tilting; human; male; measurement; ophthalmology; physical examination; priority journal; strabismus; Adult; Aged; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Eye Movements; Female; Head Movements; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Ophthalmology; Posture; Strabismus; Vision, Binocular",,"Granet, D.B.; Dept.

An early interest in the developing science of Pathology in the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh was expanded further when he moved to London, due to financial needs. Despite being outside the London teaching hospital scene, he continued to publish and teach in the private schools of the time. His interest in ophthalmology led him to describe what we now know as retinoblastoma, with recommendation for treatment. He also described sympathetic ophthalmitis and performed paracentesis in acute angle-closure glaucoma. He became surgeon to the Prince of Wales, later King George IV, but his criticism of other medical men at court led to his exclusion from the King at the scene of his death. He owned a notable collection of pictures and presented two of them to the National Gallery of Scotland on its foundation in 1850. In recent years, his work has been recognised by leading ophthalmologists, particularly in the USA.

Methods: Surveys were mailed to 126 ophthalmology residency program directors/coordinators and requested to be distributed to 1,381 ophthalmology residents. The questionnaire addressed issues related to contact lens training, hours of clinical and didactic training, comfort with fitting a variety of different types of contact lenses and dealing with common contact lens-related complications, and plans for incorporation of contact lens dispensing into future practice. Results: Two hundred and forty-nine residents (18%) responded from 84 programs (67%). Most programs (87%) have some form of supervised contact lens training, frequently conducted by an optometrist (61% of programs), that consists of 20 hours or less of clinical experience and 20 hours or less of didactic training. A majority of the responding graduating residents (66%) feel comfortable fitting spherical soft contact lenses, while less than half of all residents feel comfortable fitting any other type of contact lens. In addition, most residents (65%) feel comfortable diagnosing and treating common contact lens-related complications. Conclusions: Most ophthalmology residency programs offer some form of supervised contact lens training which allows a majority of residents to feel comfortable fitting only spherical soft contact lenses, while also dealing comfortably with most contact lens-related problems.

Methods and Data: Nonlinear exponential regression analyses were used to estimate relationships between medical care expenditures in 1996 and adherence to guideline-based measures that year, adjusting for differences in patients' demographics, location, plan type, and severity of illness. Adherence to criteria regarding physician visits, eye exams, blood sugar tests, urinalysis, triglyceride tests, total cholesterol tests, and HDL cholesterol tests was studied for 18,403 patients in 35 health plans. Results: Average total medical expenditures would be $713 higher if all patients were treated according to the guideline-based measures in 1996, compared to what expenditures would be if no patients were treated that way. Average diabetes-related expenditures would be about $322 higher. Two important exceptions to this pattern were for adherence to the suggested frequency of hemoglobin A1c blood sugar tests and ophthalmology visits for dilated eye exams. Having the recommended number of these tests was associated with significantly lower total expenditures. Conclusions: In general, adherence to clinical practice guideline-based measures was more costly than deviating from those criteria, in the short-run. Perhaps expenditures should be higher for many patients who are not treated according to guidelines. Randomized studies with more years of follow-up should be conducted to assess whether short-term investments in guideline adherence pay off with lower medical expenditures and greater levels of health in the long term.","Diabetes; Practice guidelines; Quality of care","adult; article; cost minimization analysis; diabetes mellitus; diagnostic test; female; glucose blood level; health care cost; health care quality; human; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology; practice guideline; priority journal; regression analysis; treatment indication",,"Ozminkowski, R.J.; Outcomes Res.

Case Report: We present a case of acquired nonaccommodative esotropia at 20 months of age in a subject participating in the Berkeley Infant Biometry Study, a longitudinal study of emmetropization and ocular component development in infants between 3 months and 3 years of age. Ocular components for this child were normal before the onset of strabismus (within 2 SD's of the mean for orthotropic study participants) for refractive error, corneal power, lens radii, lens power, and ocular axial dimensions. Refractive error postsurgically was significantly more hyperopic and crystalline lens power lower than average at +2.38 D and 37.2 D, respectively. Conclusions: The lack of abnormal ocular parameters is consistent with the idiopathic etiology of acute onset esotropia. This case suggests that ocular component values may not be useful for assessing the risk of acquired nonaccommodative esotropia.A case of acquired nonaccommodative esotropia at 20 months of age in a subject participating in the Berkeley Infant Biometry Study is presented.

There was a return rate of 73%. Results: Problems identified in the clinics were: (1) many diabetic patients who complain chiefly of ophthalmological symptoms voluntarily request their first ophthalmological examination; (2) appropriate cooperation between ophthalmologists and physicians is not established; (3) assessing the level of blood glucose control is difficult; and (4) scheduling of appointments is inadequate. Moreover, (1) inadequate handling of patients who discontinue their ophthalmological examinations, and (2) the lack of an established patient education program were seen as problems common to both hospitals and clinics. Conclusions: For the resolution of these problems, comprehensive countermeasures should be developed urgently by medical associations, medical administrators, and other relevant entities.

They have created several new initiatives that have the potential to dramatically affect preventable and treatable blindness, worldwide. The first international ophthalmological organization (the International Council of Ophthalmology, established in 1927) evolved from the longest continuously held medical meeting in the world (the International Congress of Ophthalmology, first held in 1857). Subsequently, a number of supranational and international organizations have been created, and these groups are beginning to communicate with each other and with national ophthalmological societies in joint planning. The international nongovernmental organizations, lay ophthalmic international organizations (eg, International Agency for the Prevention of Blindness), and the World Health Organization have recently joined to create a proposal called Vision 2020: The Right to Sight. The International Council in partnership with Academia Ophthalmolgica Internationalis has created a parallel and complementary plan, Vision for the Future. The potential to alleviate or prevent blindness in over 150 million people requires our attention. Understanding the seemingly complex interrelationships of these many organizations-often unfamiliar to American ophthalmology-is important for the uniquely strong ophthalmic organizations in the United States. American involvement can make a difference.

This study aimed to review the results of high-volume cataract surgery performed at Umtata General Hospital, an academic hospital, during an 'eye surgery camp' held over a weekend. Subjects and design. Ninety-eight cataract operations were performed over 3 days at Umtata Hospital during an eye camp to reduce backlog of cataract surgery in the Eastern Cape. After media announcement, patients were selected for cataract surgery and comprehensive pre-operative evaluation was done. Three qualified surgeons operated on the patients. Outcome measures. Patients were reviewed at day 1 and at 3- and 6-week intervals in order to study the outcome of such operations. Results. A total of 92.4% of patients achieved visual acuity of 6/60 or better at 6 weeks postoperatively. The surgical complication rate was minimal and overall satisfactory surgical outcome was observed in these cases. Conclusion. Teaching hospitals with dedicated ophthalmic operating facilities can be utilised for high-volume cataract surgery over designated short-term periods and can provide a good alternative to mobile eye camp surgery. Until primary and secondary care facilities are optimal for cataract screening and surgery, such camps are recommended to reduce backlog of cataract surgery in the country.",,"adult; aged; article; cataract; cataract extraction; controlled study; eye surgery; female; general hospital; health care facility; human; major clinical study; male; ophthalmology; postoperative complication; postoperative period; preoperative evaluation; primary medical care; screening; South Africa; surgeon; teaching hospital; treatment outcome; visual acuity; Academic Medical Centers; Aged; Aged, 80 and over; Cataract Extraction; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Patient Satisfaction; Postoperative Period; South Africa; Visual Acuity",,"Surka, J.; Department of Ophthalmology, University of Transkei, Umtata, South Africa",,"11680328",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034796686

One hundred and fifty-two patients with diabetes underwent comprehensive ophthalmologic examination by an active duty U.S. Air Force (ADAF) staff ophthalmologist, and the examination findings were used as the criterion standard for the present study. Eight other ophthalmologists (M.D.'s) and 10 optometrists (O.D.'s), all ADAF providers, each evaluated seven nonstereo standard field DFP images from the left and right eyes (14 images per patient) of the 152 diabetic patients, assessing each patient for evidence of diabetic retinopathy (yes, no, not sure). The sensitivity, specificity, and proportion of ""not sure"" responses were computed separately for MD and OD reviewers and then compared. O.D. reviewers gave ""not sure"" responses more frequently than M.D.'s. With ""not sure"" responses treated as correct (i.e., identical to the results of ophthalmologic examination), both types of providers had 100% sensitivity for cases that are usually treated and 83% sensitivity for cases that are not usually treated but require close follow-up. Specificity (for any diabetic retinopathy) was 92% for M.D.'s and 93% for O.D.'s. With M.D.'s as photographic reviewers, DFP-based screening required only 27 ophthalmologic examinations per 100 patients screened; with O.D.'s as photographic reviewers, 31 ophthalmologic examinations were required per 100 patients screened.

We carried out a survey to determine the knowledge, attitudes and practices of British Columbia cataract surgeons regarding evidence-based medicine and outcome assessment. Methods: The survey was conducted in the spring of 1999. The study population was drawn from the directory of the British Columbia College of Physicians and Surgeons. A 16-item questionnaire designed to elicit the knowledge of, attitudes toward and use of evidence-based medicine and outcome assessment was sent to all surgeons performing cataract surgery in British Columbia. Results: Of the 103 eligible participants, 70 (68%) returned completed questionnaires. Surgeons affiliated with the University of British Columbia were more likely to respond than those not affiliated with the university (81% vs. 58%) (p < 0.05). Most surgeons (89%) viewed the responsibility of monitoring quality of care as primarily their own. Although 79% of the respondents felt that outcome assessment is an effective method for determining quality of care, less than half (49%) reported that they routinely include some form of outcome assessment in their clinical practice. There was wide variation in the respondents' understanding of the nature of outcome assessment and evidence-based medicine. Respondents professed little inclination or motivation to committing time or resources to an outcome program. They also expressed concerns over the use of outcome data for external management activities. Interpretation: Cataract surgeons in British Columbia clearly appreciate the advantages of outcome assessment, but translation of this understanding into practice is limited. There appears to be a need for further education on outcome assessment and evidence-based medicine through academic bodies and professional societies.","Cataract; Evidence-based medicine; Outcome assessment; Visual function","article; Canada; cataract; cataract extraction; clinical practice; evidence based medicine; human; major clinical study; medical specialist; ophthalmology; outcomes research; physician attitude; quality of life; questionnaire; responsibility; surgeon",,"Courtright, P.; B.C.

There are a number of situations in which the single-button technique leads to ambiguous results. In this study, we thus expected the yes/no method to reduce tendencies towards habituation and automatic responding. Our hypothesis was that the two-button technique could reduce the rate of erroneous responses. Methods: Luminance-difference sensitivity for bright stimuli (32′) on a photopic background was evaluated at 26 locations within the central visual field (30°) using a specially equalised video display unit and a modified 4/2-dB staircase strategy (six reversals, maximum-likelihood threshold estimation). Sixty-one ophthalmologically normal subjects (aged 20-30 years) were examined twice with each method. Results: Mean sensitivities with the two-button yes/no method were found to be, on average, 0.13 dB above those measured with the one-button yes/time-out technique - a difference without clinical relevance. Within-subject variability did not differ between the two methods. However, the less intuitive two-button yes/no method had a slightly higher number of false responses in catch trials. Conclusion: Compared to the conventional one-button yes/time-out method, the two-button yes/no method in normal young subjects thus showed little difference in mean sensitivities and equivalent within-subject variabilities. Concerning our initial hypothesis, the yes/no method is of somewhat higher complexity and is not able to reduce the rate of erroneous responses. The one-button yes/time-out method fared a little better in error rate. In summary, the yes/no method is an alternative and additional possibility of response acquisition in visual-field testing, which is worthy of being tested in a clinical study with elderly subjects.",,"adult; article; automation; brightness; controlled study; diagnostic error; evaluation; female; habituation; human; human experiment; hypothesis; luminance; male; normal human; ophthalmology; priority journal; psychometry; sensitivity and specificity; stimulus; technique; time; vision test; visual field; Adult; False Positive Reactions; Female; Humans; Male; Perimetry; Predictive Value of Tests; Psychometrics; Questionnaires; Reproducibility of Results; Sensitivity and Specificity; Visual Fields","97",,,"11405066",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035002143

As the significance of technical aids has increased, medicine has become more tightly bound to technology. Telemedicine is one of the fastest developing fields, as its development is connected to the development of telecommunication and information technology. Technology sets the ultimate restrictions to telemedicine. However, most challenges are nontechnical. Fast development makes it difficult to perform generalizable studies on the field, and the lack of practical, applicable standardization hinders telemedical system design. The cost of technology is quickly falling compared with the cost of human labour. Because of these factors the efficient use of telemedicine requires strategic decisions at the level of the organization as well as more research concerning the effects of telemedicine on medical practice.

To present a unique case of Alport's syndrome in monozygotic twins with two different treatment modalities - renal transplantation and hemodialysis, and to evaluate the effects of therapy on hearing and ophthalmological findings. Methods. Pure-tone audiogram and ophthalmologic examinations were performed in both twins at the age of 30. At the age of 46, 4 years after renal transplantation in the first twin and after 6 years of hemodialysis in the second twin, both twins underwent control audiometric and ophthalmologic examinations. Results. Control audiometric measurements showed the progression of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss in the high-frequency range (> 2000 Hz) in both twins. The hearing threshold progressed from initial 50 dB in both twins at the time of the diagnosis to 55 dB in the twin on hemodialysis, and 85 dB in the twin with a transplanted kidney. Retinal blurry hyperpigmentations disappeared in the twin with a transplanted kidney. Conclusion.

Complications are infrequent and generally easily managed with minimal problems. In this clinical research study, 100 internal chalazia surgical candidates were randomly divided into two treatment groups. Our initial goal was to ascertain whether cautery impacted the recurrence rates on chalazia in these patients. One group received thermal cautery after surgical incision and drainage. The second group did not receive cautery after incision and drainage. Lack of cautery caused no problems with hemostasis because bleeding resolved without incident after several additional minutes. Methods: The study was conducted on 100 patients who received 4 weeks of conservative treatment consisting of alternating warm and cold compresses and topical prednisolone acetate/sulfa medication (e.g., blephamide) administered 4 times a day. A transconjunctival incision and drainage was performed, followed by thermal cautery in one-half (N = 50) of the randomized patients. Results: The cauterized group had a 78% no recurrence rate after 6 months and good surgical outcomes. The remaining 22% had a recurrence of chalazia, but with good initial surgical outcome. The noncauterized group (N = 50) showed a 74% no recurrence rate after 6 months and good surgical outcome. The remaining 26% had recurrences with good initial surgical outcomes. A chi-square test indicated that there was no significant statistical difference between the groups (X2 = 0.219, dF = 1.0, p = 0.640). Conclusion: The results of this clinical study suggest that the use of thermal cautery with surgery has no impact on the recurrence rate of internal chalazia. Thus, the use of thermal cautery should be left to the discretion of the eye care practitioner.","Chalazia recurrence; Chalazion surgery; Sebaceous carcinoma; Thermal cautery","prednisolone acetate; sulfacetamide; adolescent; adult; article; cauterization; chalazion; conservative treatment; controlled study; female; human; major clinical study; male; priority journal; recurrent disease; sebaceous carcinoma; statistical analysis; surgical technique; treatment outcome; Patient treatment; Surgery; Vision; Chalazia recurrence; Chalazion surgery; Sebaceous carcinoma; Thermal cautery; Ophthalmology",,"Sendrowski, D.P.; Southern California Coll. of Optom., 2575 Yorba Linda Blvd., Fullerton, CA 92831, United States; email: dsendrowski@scco.edu","Lippincott Williams and Wilkins","11138835",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034351446

The pathogenesis of the diabetic CWS has been well established but is not clear in HIV disease. This study documents a morphological difference between cotton wool spots observed in diabetes mellitus and HIV infection. Methods: Electronic images of 47 diabetic CWS and 38 HIV CWS were compared in terms of eccentricity. Each CWS was enlarged, and its major and minor axes were determined. Eccentricity was determined by use of a simple ratio of major vs. minor axis. The eccentricity of these diabetic and HIV CWS were compared by use of the Mann- Whitney rank sum test to check for significance. Results: The HIV CWS was significantly more eccentric (p ≤ 0.001), thus suggesting a different morphology than its diabetic counterpart. Conclusions: There seems to be a significant difference in the morphology of the cotton wool spots observed in diabetes mellitus compared with those observed in HIV infection. This difference suggests that, at some level, the pathogeneses of these two CWS are not the same. Clinically, the practitioner should strongly suspect HIV disease in a patient with boomerang-shaped cotton wool spots.","Cotton wool spot; Diabetes mellitus; Eccentricity; HIV; Morphology; Retinopathy","article; clinical article; diabetes mellitus; human; Human immunodeficiency virus infection; ophthalmoscopy; pathogenesis; priority journal; retina; retinopathy; scoring system; Functional assessment; Morphology; Sensory feedback; Viruses; Vision; Wool; Diabetes mellitus; Human immuno-deficiency virus(HIV); Retinal cotton wool spot (CWS); Retinopathy; Ophthalmology",,"Jaworski, C.; Nova Southeastern University, College of Optometry, 1111 W.

Methods: Simple and multiple correlation coefficients were computed from data obtained from a sample of three consecutive classes of optometry students (1995-1997; n = 278) at Southern California College of Optometry. Results: The GPA after year two of optometry school was the highest correlation (r = 0.75) among all predictor variables; the average of all scores on the OAT was the highest correlation among preoptometry predictor variables (r = 0.46). Stepwise regression analysis indicated a combination of the optometry GPA, the OAT Academic Average, and the GPA in certain optometry curricular tracks resulted in an improved correlation (multiple r = 0.81). Predicted NBEOPI scores were computed from the regression equation and then analyzed by receiver operating characteristic (roc) and statistic of agreement (κ) methods. From this analysis, we identified the predicted score that maximized identification of true and false NBEOPI failures (71% and 10%, respectively). Cross validation of this result on a separate class of optometry students resulted in a slightly lower correlation between actual and predicted NBEOPI scores (r = 0.77) but showed the criterion-predicted score to be somewhat lax. Conclusions: The optometry school GPA after 2 years is a reasonably good predictor of performance on the full NBEOPI examination, but the prediction is enhanced by adding the Academic Average OAT score. However, predicting performance in certain subject areas of the NBEOPI examination, for example Psychology and Ocular/Visual Biology, was rather insubstantial. Nevertheless, predicting NBEOPI performance from the best combination of year two optometry GPAs and preoptometry variables is better than has been shown in previous studies predicting optometry GPA from the best combination of preoptometry variables.","Decision making; National Board of Examiners in Optometry; Optometric education; Optometry Admission Test","Correlation methods; Decision making; Medical education; Regression analysis; Students; Grade point averages; National Board of Examiners in Optometry; Optometric education; Optometry admission test; Receiver operating characteristic; Statistic of agreement methods; Ophthalmology; academic achievement; article; certification; correlation function; human; medical education; optometry; prediction; priority journal; school",,"Bailey, J.E.; Southern California Coll.

I remember hearing the speakers during the retinal section of the conference describing the new and exciting innovation in their subspecialty, the pars plana vitrectomy. The anterior segment authorities spoke excitedly about the intraocular lens, a radical new solution to the optical problems associated with aphakia. The first soft contact lens had been recently approved for general use, and there were glowing reports about its successful application in previously contact lens-intolerant patients. By that stage of my training, I had already decided on a career as a pediatric ophthalmologist. So it was with great anticipation that I awaited the section of the program devoted to strabismus. The moderator of those lectures began with an acknowledgment of the great advances that had been made in other areas of ophthalmology, and continued with, 'Actually, we are not doing anything differently in the treatment of strabismus than we were 50 years ago.'

We present a family with pathologic myopia, corneal dystrophy, and deafness distinct from these syndromes. Cases: Ten patients in the same Turkish family were evaluated by ophthalmologic, audiologic, physical, radiologic, genetic, serologic, and biochemical examinations. Observations: Ophthalmic examination indicated that all the cases had myopia, 7 of them had pathologic myopia, 1 had intermediate, and 2 had mild. Four of the patients with pathologic myopia had corneal dystrophy that was bilaterally manifest as white opacities in the posterior stroma near Descemet's membrane in an axial distribution; 1 of these 4 patients also had a tilted disc. Otolaryngologic examination revealed conductive hearing loss in 3 cases, mixed hearing loss in 2, and sensorineural hearing loss in 1. The results of karyotypic analyses of all cases were normal. The pedigree analysis showed the disease was inherited through successive generations as an autosomal dominant trait. The results of biochemical, serologic, and radiologic investigations were normal. The same pathophysiologic process in all cases seemed to account for the myopia, the corneal dystrophy and the deafness.

The results were compared with those obtained from a group of 30 healthy age-matched males and they were correlated with the psoriasis area and severity index (PASI), the skin surface area involved, duration of the disease and duration of the last relapse. In neurological and ophthalmological examinations no pathological symptoms were detected in either group. The VEP examination was executed using pattern reversal (pr) and pattern flash (pf) stimulation. Results: Using pf stimulation, in the group of patients with psoriasis vulgaris, a statistically significant elongation in the latency of P-100 and reduction of response amplitude, not related to the PASI, nor the skin surface area involved, nor duration of the last relapse, were observed. Conclusions: The results of the study indicate subclinical damage of the visual pathway in patients with psoriasis vulgaris.","Electrophysiology; Neuro-mediators; Neuro-physiology; Psoriasis vulgaris; Visual evoked potentials","adult; amplitude modulation; article; clinical article; clinical trial; comparative study; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; correlation function; disease association; disease duration; disease severity; epidemiological data; evoked visual response; human; latent period; male; multiple sclerosis; nervous system function; neurologic examination; ophthalmology; pattern stimulation; population risk; psoriasis vulgaris; quantitative assay; relapse; risk assessment; risk factor; skin surface; statistical analysis; symptom; visual system; Adolescent; Adult; Evoked Potentials, Visual; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Psoriasis; Visual Pathways",,"Grzybowski, A.; Department of Ophthalmology, Karol Marcinkowski University, School of Medical Sciences, Dluga 1/2, 60-848 Poznań, Poland; email: Andrzej_Grzybowski@um.poznan.pl",,"11824655",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035687463

Methods: Self-administered questionnaires were mailed to Australian ophthalmologists prior to release of the NHMRC guidelines for the management of diabetic retinopathy, and at one and 2.5 years after release of the guidelines. The questionnaires elicited information about current management practices in relation to diabetic retinopathy. Results: The response rate for the baseline and two follow-up surveys was 82%, 81%, and 80%, respectively. More than 85% of the ophthalmologists responded that the guidelines were useful in improving management, were easy to understand, and were already part of their routine clinical practice. A relatively small percentage (12%) felt that the guidelines made recommendations that were not practical or feasible. Contrary to the NHMRC guidelines, at the second follow-up survey, only 50% of the ophthalmologists said that they would almost never perform fluorescein angiography in eyes with mild non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The change from baseline to the second follow-up in the percentage of ophthalmologists who would perform cataract surgery after treating clinically significant macular oedema (as advised by the NHMRC guidelines) was statistically significant (baseline = 83.7%, 95% confidence limit = 80.4, 87.0; second follow up = 90.4, 95% confidence limit = 87.3, 93.5). Conclusions: Distribution of the printed NHMRC Clinical Practice Guidelines: Management of Diabetic Retinopathy and full colour Retinopathy Chart resulted in a significant change in the recommended order of treatment of clinically significant macular oedema. However, no significant change in the use of fluorescein angiography was documented.","Diabetic retinopathy; Evaluation studies; Physicians' practice patterns; Practice guidelines","article; Australia; cataract extraction; clinical practice; clinical protocol; diabetic retinopathy; disease severity; eye; fluorescence angiography; follow up; health survey; human; medical assessment; physician; practice guideline; questionnaire; retina macula edema; statistical analysis; Australia; Diabetic Retinopathy; Diagnostic Techniques, Ophthalmological; Health Knowledge, Attitudes, Practice; Health Services Research; Humans; National Health Programs; Ophthalmology; Physician's Practice Patterns; Practice Guidelines; Questionnaires; Referral and Consultation",,"Wright, S.; Centre for Eye Research Australia, University of Melbourne, Royal Victorian Eye and Ear Hospital, 32 Gisborne Street, East Melbourne, Vic. 3002, Australia; email: suzie@cera.unimelb.edu.au",,"11545421",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034872228

When it occurs asymmetrically or unilaterally, a cause should be sought because it may help us to understand the pathophysiology of this condition better. We describe a patient with unilateral pigmentary glaucoma and the Adie pupil in the same eye and discuss the possible role of the Adie pupil in the development of the pigmentary glaucoma. METHODS: A case report. A 37-year-old woman presented with asymmetric pigment dispersion resulting in pigmentary glaucoma in the right eye and an unilateral Adie pupil in the same eye. RESULTS: We believe that the dilated Adie pupil in the right eye might have resulted in a decreased amount of relative pupillary block. This, then, might have led to an increased contact between the posterior iris and the zonules, resulting in greater pigment dispersion and trabecular obstruction in the right eye. CONCLUSION: It has been proposed that the pigment is liberated from the iris pigment epithelium because of the mechanical rubbing of the posterior iris against the anterior zonular packets. Our case supports this proposed mechanism of pigment release.

Any imbalance in this regulatory circuit may lead to the development of a number of angiogenesis-mediated diseases. Angiogenesis is a multi-step process including activation, adhesion, migration, proliferation and transmigration of endothelial cells across cell matrices to or from new capillaries and from existing vessels. Angiogenesis is a process involved in the formation of new vessels by sprouting from pre-existing vessels. In contrast, vessel rudiments are sorted by a process termed vasculogenesis. Endothelial heterogeneity and organ specificity might contribute to differences in the response to different anti-angiogenic mechanisms (cultured EC versus microvascular EC isolated from different tissues). Under normal physiological conditions in mature organisms, endothelial cell turnover or angiogenesis is extremely slow (from months to years). However, angiogenesis can be activated for a limited time in certain situations such as wound healing and ovulation. In certain pathological states, such as human metastasis (oncology) and ocular neovascularisation, disorders including diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration (ophthalmology), there is excessive and sustained angiogenesis. Hence, understanding the mechanisms involved in the regulation of angiogenesis could have a major impact in the prevention and treatment of pathological angiogenic processes. Additionally, endothelial cells play a major role in the modelling of blood vessels. The interplay of growth factors, cell adhesion molecules, matrix proteases and specific signal transduction pathways either in the maintenance of the quiescent state or in the reactivation of endothelial cells is critical in physiological and pathological angiogenic processes.","Angiogenesis; Anticoagulants; Matric Metalloproteinases; Monoclonal antibodies; Ocular","2 methoxyestradiol; anecortave; angiogenesis inhibitor; angiogenic factor; anticoagulant agent; cell adhesion molecule; collagen type 4; growth factor; heparin; high molecular weight kininogen; imc 1c 11; integrin; kininostatin; low molecular weight heparin; matrix metalloproteinase inhibitor; monoclonal antibody; proteinase; tinzaparin; tissue factor pathway inhibitor; unclassified drug; vasculotropin; vasculotropin antibody; vasculotropin receptor; vitronectin; angiogenesis; animal cell; article; cancer therapy; capillary; cell activation; cell adhesion; cell culture; cell heterogeneity; cell isolation; cell migration; cell proliferation; cell transfer; clinical trial; controlled clinical trial; controlled study; diabetic retinopathy; disease course; endothelium cell; extracellular matrix; eye disease; human; metastasis; model; nonhuman; nuclear magnetic resonance imaging; ophthalmology; ovulation; pathology; phase 1 clinical trial; phase 2 clinical trial; phase 3 clinical trial; physiology; protein domain; rat; regulatory mechanism; retina macula degeneration; side effect; signal transduction; solid tumor; tissue; turnover time; wound healing; Angiogenesis Inhibitors; Antibodies, Monoclonal; Anticoagulants; Humans; Neovascularization, Pathologic",,"Mousa, S.A.; DuPont Pharmaceuticals Co., Wilmington, DE, United States",,"11424887",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035147091

A secondary goal was to evaluate the extent of spatial summation on a dynamic version of vernier hyperacuity. Methods. The ODT's and contrast sensitivity functions (CSF's) of optimally corrected young and old observers were compared as a function of vernier target length (4, 8, or 32 min), contrast level (5 or 30%), and oscillation rate (2 or 8 Hz). Results. Age deficits on ODT's were related directly to rate of oscillation, but not target contrast. No age difference was seen in ODT's for short low-contrast targets; as target length increased thresholds improved more rapidly for young than old observers; this pattern was reversed at high contrast. ODT's were related strongly and consistently to contrast sensitivity for old but not young observers. Conclusions. Diminished spatial summation appears to contribute to the aging visual system's loss of temporal discrimination for low contrast oscillating targets. Spatial summation contributes more importantly to the displacement discrimination of oscillating than to static vernier targets.","Contrast; Motion; Oscillatory displacement; Spatial summation; Vernier acuity","Ophthalmology; Oscillations; Patient monitoring; Vernier oscillations; Vision; adult; aged; aging; article; clinical article; female; human; male; oscillation; priority journal; spatial discrimination; spatial summation; visual acuity; visual disorder",,"Kline, D.W.; Vision Lab., Department of Psychology, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, Calgary, Alta.

To determine whether macular photocoagulation has any effect on refraction in diabetics. Methods. This was a prospective study of 12 eyes of 12 diabetics with refraction at 2 weeks before and at 4 weeks and 4 months after argon laser. This was combined with a questionnaire survey of attitude among ophthalmologists on prescribing spectacles for diabetics awaiting macular laser. The main outcome measure was the spherical equivalents (SEQ) before and after treatment. Results. Only 36% of ophthalmologists surveyed would prescribe corrective lenses in patients waiting for macular photocoagulation. The median change in magnitude of SEQ at 4-6 weeks post-laser compared to pre-laser was 0.36 D (interquartile range 0.18-0.50 D). The median change in SEQ at 4 months was 0.25 D (interquartile range 0.12-0.56 D). These changes in SEQ from pretreatment values were not statistically significant on Wilcoxon signed-rank test (p = 0.17 and 0.10, respectively). The correlation coefficient between difference and average SEQ was 0.02 (95% CI - 0.14 to 0.19, p = 0.75) at 4 weeks and 0.11 (95% CI - 0.06 to 0.275, p = 0.17) at 4 months, indicating no tendency for change in refraction with increasing ametropia. Conclusion. This pilot study implies that argon laser photocoagulation in diabetic maculopathy does not alter refraction.

In this article we discuss one major factor, namely, fluctuations in the surgeon's accommodative state, coupled with an inaccurate setting of the slit-lamp oculars. Design: Experimental study. Methods: We analyzed and tested the optics of slit-lamp mounted lasers. Varying the ocular setting is correlated with measurements of the actual spot size obtained with each system. Main Outcome Measure: The spot size obtained. Results: Three distinct, but related, phenomena that may lead to spot size errors are defined: (1) focusing the laser spot as opposed to focusing the retinal image; (2) instrument misalignment; (3) inadvertent accommodation. Conclusion: The ocular setting must be meticulously calibrated to produce a true spot-sized burn. At the 50 μm setting, each diopter of induced accommodation, or erroneous ocular setting, almost doubles the actual spot size obtained. With large (500 μm) spot size settings, the defocused delivery system is more prone to spot-size errors in contrast with parfocal lasers.

T3A 2N1, Canada","Operations for cataract have been performed for centuries; however, it was not until the late 1940s that the concept of an artificial intraocular lens was developed by Harold Ridley, an ophthalmologist practising in London. The first and epoch-making operation took place at St. Thomas' Hospital, London on 29 November 1949. Ridley implanted about 1000 intraocular lenses over the next few years. The complication rate at first was high but, by trial and error, progress was gradually made. The idea of implanting an artificial lens in the eye of a patient was anathema to large segments of the ophthalmology community and inevitably called forth discourteous reactions, especially from within the academic establishment in Europe and the United States of America. Even in the 1970s, few ophthalmologists gave any thought to Ridley's operation. Recognition finally occurred. He received the highest honour that British scientists can confer when in 1986 he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. He feels rewarded by the knowledge that sight of natural quality is restored to millions of patients all over the world. One recognition that many felt was long overdue was finally consummated early in the new millennium, when Queen Elizabeth II conferred on him a knighthood. Now 94 years old, he lives with his wife Elisabeth in a thatched seventeenth-century cottage by the banks of the River Wylie in the picturesque village of Stapleford, Wiltshire, not far from Stonehenge. © 2000 Harcourt Publishers Ltd.","History; Intraocular; Lenses","article; cataract extraction; clinical practice; clinical trial; complication; error; Europe; hospital; human; implantation; lens implant; medical education; medical society; medical specialist; ophthalmology; priority journal; science; United Kingdom; United States; university hospital",,"Hamilton, R.C.; Gimbel Eye Centre, 4935 Fortieth Avenue Northwest, Calgary, Alta.

A review is presented of patient histories from 5 patients with acute-onset unilateral idiopathic haemorrhagic retinopathy, including results of ophthalmological, haematological and fluorescein angiographic examinations. Results. All patients had an extensive deep blot haemorrhagic retinopathy without significant vascular signs or abnormal optic discs. In 4 cases the haemorrhage was sufficiently severe to break through into the vitreous. Fluorescein angiography demonstrated normal arteriovenous flow, without capillary non-perfusion, vessel or disc leakage. Disc swelling, macular oedema and cotton wool spots were not seen at any stage in these patients. All patients recovered the visual acuity in the affected eye by 4 months. Systemic examination in all cases was unremarkable. Conclusion. This distinct and rare form of retinopathy is important to define since it has a good prognosis without treatment.","Retinal haemorrhage","adult; article; blood analysis; clinical article; clinical examination; disease course; disease severity; female; fluorescence angiography; hemorrhagic retinopathy; human; male; medical record; ophthalmology; optic disk; perfusion; prognosis; retina blood flow; retina blood vessel; retina capillary; retina macula edema; retinopathy; retrospective study; visual acuity; vitreous body",,"Grey, R.H.B.; Bristol Eye Hospital, Lower Maudlin Street, Bristol BS1 2LX, United Kingdom","Royal College of Ophthalmologists","11450718",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034960636

The chips are implanted into the sub-retinal space. Electric current generated in tiny micro-photodiodes is delivered to the neuronal network in the retina via micro-electrodes. Since the coupling between electrode and tissue is capacitive of nature, only transient signals may be used for stimulation. Accordingly, a high capacitance of the interface between electrodes and tissue is an important prerequisite for efficient charge transfer. In addition, the electric properties of the micro-photodiodes as are reflected in current/voltage traces have a profound influence on the overall charge delivery. Therefore, the entire system made up of micro-photodiode array, electrode/electrolyte interface and tissue has to be taken into consideration. Current diversity has been both calculated and measured based on current/voltage traces and electrode capacitance data. Our results indicate charged balanced operation of the device and a non-zero electrode polarization. The latter may be avoided, if an active current sink is employed in order to draw backward current.","Charge transfer; Electric stimulation; Micro-electrode; Micro-photodiode array; Retina implant","Biomedical engineering; Electric properties; Functional electric stimulation; Interfaces (materials); Microelectrodes; Neurophysiology; Ophthalmology; Tissue; Artificial retina implant; Microphotodiode array; Implants (surgical)",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034445772

Accidents were the only occupational diagnoses recorded, and this occurred in 75 (5.6%) of cases. The findings indicate that doctors who train in this specialty should gain experience in industries that have sizeable occupational health services, in addition to their formal ophthalmology training, in order to acquire experience in primary and occupational eye care.

These established entities have recently codified their statutes and regulations and registered them in Zurich, Switzerland. METHODS: The International Council of Ophthalmology, which serves as the executive body of the International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies, used historical operating documents to prepare the statutes and regulations, which were reviewed and adopted by the International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies at the 28th International Congress of Ophthalmology in Amsterdam on June 23, 1998. RESULTS: The statutes and regulations of the International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies, the International Council of Ophthalmology, and the International Congress of Ophthalmology are available to supranational ophthalmological organizations, national ophthalmological societies, other ophthalmological organizations, and individual ophthalmologists. CONCLUSIONS: The statutes and regulations of the International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies, the International Council of Ophthalmology, and the International Congress of Ophthalmology provide a basis for an organizational structure in international ophthalmology. The International Congress of Ophthalmology, first held in 1857, is the longest continuing international meeting in medicine. The International Council of Ophthalmology was established in 1927, and the International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies was formed in 1933. These organizations coordinate the International Congress of Ophthalmology, which convenes with the International Federation of Ophthalmological Societies every 4 years. The International Council, as the executive body, meets annually. The International Council of Ophthalmology has for decades worked to coordinate and facilitate interchange, education, and standards in international ophthalmology. Currently, the International Council of Ophthalmology, working with other international organizations, is creating an international ophthalmology strategic plan, which includes focus on ophthalmic training, continuing education, advocacy for the preservation and restoration of vision, clinical guidelines, and research. © Published by Elsevier Science Inc.",,"blindness; eye disease; medical specialist; organization; physician; priority journal; responsibility; review; Constitution and Bylaws; Humans; International Agencies; Ophthalmology; Societies, Medical; World Health",,,,"11004299",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033833218

For many ophthalmologists a simple look at this revered P value is enough evidence that a statistically significant result has indeed been obtained. Unfortunately, traditional interpretation of a study based on the P value at an arbitrary cut-off (P<0.05 or any other value) limits the ability to fully appreciate clinical implications. In this article the authors introduce the reader to and illustrate the use of ""confidence intervals"" as opposed to P values in examining the applicability of study results. Further, what is statistically significant may not necessarily be clinically significant; perhaps not enough for the practitioner to change from the currently preferred method of treatment. To resolve this, the authors have also used common ophthalmic examples to introduce the ""number needed to treat"", as a simple clinical approach for the practising ophthalmologist wishing to assess the clinical significance of treatment options.","Confidence intervals; Number needed to treat; P value","clinical trial; confidence interval; epidemiology; eye disease; human; ophthalmology; review; statistical analysis; statistics; Clinical Trials; Confidence Intervals; Data Interpretation, Statistical; Epidemiologic Methods; Eye Diseases; Humans; Ophthalmology",,"Thomas, R.; Department of Ophthalmology, Christian Medical College, Vellore 632001, India",,"12018541",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035496080

Design: An interventional study. Place and Duration of Study: The study was conducted at Eye Department, Military Hospital Rawalpindi from June, 1993 to June, 1997. Subjects and Methods: Two hundred patients operated for cataract which included 100 patients of simple cataract extraction, while remaining patients were implanted with posterior chamber intra-ocular lens. Those who reported visual deterioration due to PCO were thoroughly investigated and YAG laser capsulotomy was performed in all such patients. Results: The study revealed a higher incidence of PCO in younger age group, 26(13%) patients developed PCO, pearl type was the most common, 6(23.07%) patients had ruptured anterior vitreous face, 4(15.38%) patients showed rise in intra-ocular pressure while one (03.84%) patient showed evidence of cystoid macular edema.

The custom of votive giving has been present in the territory of Christian Europe from ancient times until recent days. By examining the models of eyes dating from the seventeenth to the twentieth century, we came to the conclusion that they do not show any malformation, meaning that no pathological processes of eyes were shown. With their healthy form, they show the image of a healthy eye that the one who prays wishes to have. This is the opposite from the eye votives from Greek and Roman times, which were given in the ancient Esculap shrines with the desire to be healthy, because the Greek and Roman votives do show pathological processes.","Croatia; Eye votives; Folk medicine; History of medicine","article; biological model; christian; comparative study; controlled study; Croatia; cultural factor; Europe; eye disease; eye malformation; geographic distribution; Greece; health status; history of medicine; human; interview; pathology; religion; research; traditional medicine; Croatia; Eye; History, Ancient; Medicine, Traditional; Ophthalmology; Religion and Medicine; Symbolism",,"Dugac, Ž.Trg kralja Petra Kresimira 15, 10000 Zagreb, Croatia; email: dugac@hazu.hr",,"11475362",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034929784

The specific hospital tasked with the mission of supporting Operation Joint Endeavor from a support base in Taszar, Hungary, did not have any documentation authorizing the assignment of ophthalmology assets. Current Army doctrine stipulates the presence of an area support medical battalion, with assigned optometry assets, to deploy and operate near a CSH. However, in the winter of 1995, when Operation Joint Endeavor began, there were no area support medical battalions staffed in Europe, and none deployed to the Taszar support base. Therefore, the 67th CSH's mission to provide comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care on a contingency basis to all personnel in the area of operations did not have a doctrinal means of supporting an eye care requirement. Objective: To meet this eye care shortfall between doctrinal policy and actual operational needs or requirements, the optometry staff of the 67th CSH scavenged two optometry field sets from old Operation Desert Storm war stock and deployed with the main body of hospital personnel to Taszar, Hungary, on December 18, 1995. In doing so, the Table of Organization and Equipment was thus supplemented with extra equipment and personnel, beyond doctrinal guidelines, to accomplish the assigned mission. Method: This report is a prospectively gathered summary of the eye care provided from December18, 1995, to September 15, 1996. Results: A total of 1,471 patients were examined and treated, averaging 7 patients per day. Less than half of the case load was medical in nature, with the remaining being refractive in nature or for periodic examination. The most common pathologies seen were soft contact lens complications, non-contact lens corneal pathology, conjunctivitis (bacterial, viral, and adenoviral), and ocular trauma (foreign bodies, chemical splashes, blunt injury). Refractive cases during the entire deployment involved primarily myopes requiring increased correction. However, close to half of the refractive cases in the first month involved habitually uncorrected low hyperopes and early presbyopes. Conclusions: Based on the productivity presented by the case load demand of this CSH's area medical support mission, an eye care need was clearly met, adding to the overall mission success of the 67th CSH.",,"army; article; blunt trauma; chemical injury; conjunctivitis; contact lens; cornea disease; eye disease; eye injury; foreign body; health service; Hungary; optometry; Efficiency, Organizational; Hospitals, Military; Hospitals, Packaged; Humans; Hungary; International Cooperation; Military Medicine; Needs Assessment; Ophthalmology; Optometry; Outcome Assessment (Health Care); Practice Guidelines; Program Evaluation; Prospective Studies; United States; Workload",,"Bancroft, D.; 10th Mountain Division, Fort Drum, NY 13602-5004, United States",,"11197103",Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035142081

Consideration was given to the possible effects of serum levels of vitamin A. Methods: Two groups of neurologically normal HIV-positive subjects with CD4+ cell counts of <200 (n=17) or >400 (n=19) were contrasted with 20 HIV-negative controls. Rod ERGs, oscillatory potentials and cone ERGs were obtained using ganzfeld stimulation. A sequence of dark- and light-adapted EOG recordings was analyzed to obtain light/dark ratios. The HIV-positive subjects underwent a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination. Results: Intergroup comparisons failed to reveal any significant intergroup differences. Abnormal ERG findings, those exceeding the 98% confidence limits, occurred in 11% (4/36) of the HIV-positive subjects. One of these subjects was hyporetinemic and another had a subnormal retinol level. No subjects had abnormal EOGs. Conclusions: HIV infection influenced retinal function in 11% of a group of neurologically normal subjects without clinical signs of retinopathy. The profile of electrophysiological findings suggested predominant functional deficits involving middle or inner retinal layers. Vitamin A deficiency and possible vascular changes could account for the observed ERG abnormalities.

Methods: Nine ARMD patients with no exudative complications and a visual acuity of 20/60 or better in the tested eye were selected. Cardinal colour directions for the isolation of the red-green, blue-yellow and achromatic (luminance) visual mechanisms were determined for each patient. Contrast sensitivity was measured in each cardinal colour direction immediately before and 20 min after standard 20-flash fluorescein angiography. Results: A significant, albeit mild, reduction for blue-yellow contrast sensitivity following angiography was observed (ANOVA, α=0.05). Fluorescein angiographic exposure had no significant effect on red-green or luminance contrast sensitivity. Conclusion: Our results show that fluorescein angiography causes at least a short term deficit selective to blue-yellow contrast sensitivity in our patient group.

Zosteriform herpes simplex virus (HSV) infection is an uncommon presentation of HSV recurrent cutaneous infection and it is usually misdiagnosed as zoster. Methods. We report a series of consecutive cases of zosteriform HSV that we recently managed. Results. Four cases of recurrent zosteriform HSV infection in the second division of the trigeminal nerve were seen. Immunologic evaluation determined that the patients were immunocompetent. Culture and/or direct fluorescent stain diagnosed HSV. No ocular involvement was present, and all patients responded to oral acyclovir. Recommendations. Clinicians should suspect HSV infection in patients with recurrent vesicular lesions with zosteriform appearance. Immunologic evaluation is not necessary; however, ophthalmologic examination to exclude ocular involvement is required. Oral acyclovir is useful for treatment.","Children; Cutaneous HSV infection; Recurrent; Zoster","aciclovir; article; case report; child; dermatitis herpetiformis; differential diagnosis; female; herpes simplex; human; male; ophthalmology; priority journal; recurrent infection; trigeminal nerve",,"Rathore, M.H.653-1 West 8th Street, Jacksonville, FL 32209, United States; email: Mobeen.Rathore@jax.ufl.edu","Blackwell Publishing Ltd.",,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033922317

Methods: This review article covers the basic anatomy and physiology of the sinuses, followed by a discussion of disease states - acute sinusitis, chronic sinusitis, nasal polyposis, mucoceles, and benign and malignant neoplasms. Results: Recommended management of the above-mentioned disease states, including endoscopic sinus surgery and associated complications, are presented. Conclusion: Diseases affecting the paranasal sinuses are common and affect a large proportion of the population. Due to the close proximity of the sinuses to the orbit(s), inflammatory or neoplastic disease frequently presents with orbital symptoms and/or signs. It is therefore important for ophthalmologists to be familiar with these diseases.",,"article; computer assisted tomography; emphysema; endoscopic surgery; epiphora; hematoma; human; lacrimal duct; mucocele; nose polyp; ophthalmology; orbit disease; paranasal sinus disease; paranasal sinus tumor; paranasal sinusitis; visual impairment",,"Witterick, I.J.; Mount Sinai Hospital, 600 University Avenue, Toronto, Ont.

He described and named the optic papilla and the retinal nerve fibers in his book Ophthalmographia, published in 1676. He published his New Theory of Vision in 1682. While at Cambridge, he was a contemporary and a friend of Isaac Newton, with whom Briggs worked but who, in matters of visual anatomy and physiology, came to reach different conclusions from Briggs. In 1683, Briggs came to London to practice as a physician at St. Thomas' Hospital, where he established a considerable reputation as an ophthalmologist.

Design: Lacrimal sac swabs and aspirated contents of diseased sacs were analyzed in a microbiology laboratory. Place and Duration: The study was conducted at Jinnah Postgraduate Medical Center (JPMC), and Microbiology Department, Dr. Tahir's Laboratory, Hamdard University Hospital, Taj Medical Complex, Karachi from September 1997 to December 1998. Patients/Methods: Samples collected from 100 patients of dacryocystitis (group-A) who underwent dacryocystectomy or dacryocystorhinostomy at JPMC, Karachi and 50 normal cases (group-B) were processed for isolation of different bacterial species. The sensitivity pattern of isolated bacteria from both the groups was compared. Results: Bacteria isolated from group-A were Strep. pneumoniae from 21, Klebsiella pneumoniae from 8 and Strep. viridans, Enterobacter aerogenes, corynebacterium, proteus and pseudomonas species from 2 cases each, whereas lacrimal sacs of group-B were positive for Klebsiella pneumoniae in 15, E. coli in 2, Strep. pneumoniae and pseudomonas one in each cases. Strep. pneumoniae was isolated in a significantly higher number from the patients of dacryocystitis, while Klebsiella pneumoniae was significantly high in group-B cases. Bacteria encountered in dacryocystitis were resistant in majority to commonly used antibiotics i.e., ampicillin, chloramphenicol and tetracycline but sensitive to vancomycin, kanamycin and gentamycin. Conclusion: A continuous bacteriologic surveillance to identify common etiological agents along with its sensitivity is imperative. The ophthalmologists should be aware that about 50% preoperative patients without signs of ocular infection may have bacterial infection. We emphasize that the antibiotic therapy should be initiated on receipt of culture sensitivity report from a Microbiological laboratory since the antibiotic sensitivity of bacteria is largely unpredictable and multiresistant strains are common.","Dacryocystitis; Dacryocystorhinostomy; Drug sensitivity assay, microbial; Etiology; Infection; Kleb.pneumoniae; Strep.pneumoniae","ampicillin; antibiotic agent; cefalotin; chloramphenicol; gentamicin; kanamycin; meticillin; tetracycline; vancomycin; adolescent; adult; alpha hemolytic Streptococcus; antibiotic resistance; article; aspiration; bacterial infection; bacteriology; bacterium culture; bacterium isolation; child; clinical laboratory; controlled study; Corynebacterium; dacryocystectomy; dacryocystitis; dacryocystorhinostomy; drug sensitivity; Enterobacter aerogenes; Escherichia coli; eye infection; eye surgery; female; flora; hospital; human; Klebsiella pneumoniae; lacrimal sac; major clinical study; male; medical specialist; microbiology; ophthalmology; Pakistan; prediction; preoperative period; Proteus; Pseudomonas; sample; Streptococcus pneumoniae",,"Shah, Y.; Department of Pathology, Sindh Medical College, Karachi, Pakistan",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0035031488

When patients arrive at an emergency center with periorbital trauma, flat film radiographs are taken routinely - they are less costly than computerized tomography (CT) scans. When flat film radiographs are combined with preoperative CT scans, a complete representation is obtained preoperatively, enabling the selection of optimal treatment. A retrospective review of the data in patient charts was performed in a large city hospital center in order to evaluate the results. Methods and Materials. Charts of 164 patients who received trauma-related CT scans were evaluated, using the following procedures: ophthalmologic evaluation, examination of hard and soft tissues, examination of the cranial nerves, and neurologic examination. Results and/or Conclusions. In the group in whom flat film had recorded negative findings, 21 of 32 patients had positive CT findings. Orbital fractures were the most commonly involved. The lamina papyracea and orbital floor fractures received the most benefit from the use of CT scans, followed by lateral sinuses and nasoethmoidal fractures. The authors concluded that patients with periorbital trauma benefit from preoperative CT scans.","Computerized tomography; Periorbital trauma","article; clinical examination; computer assisted tomography; controlled study; correlation analysis; diagnostic value; human; major clinical study; neurologic examination; ophthalmology; orbit fracture; orbit injury; priority journal; radiography",,"Etufugh, N.N.; Nassau Oral and Maxillofacial Surg., 33 Front Street, Hempstead, NY 11550, United States",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034581704

Mackenzie is generally remembered as a great compiler of knowledge, but the text Mackenzie built around this case shows him pursuing original arguments based on his own observation.

This study is driven by the observation that a large dose such as 70-80 Gy was generally prescribed for trigeminal neuralgia, and, therefore, a small percentage (2-3%) of scattering dose to the lens of the eye could reach or even exceed its tolerance dose. In-vivo dosimetry measurements on six patients and a head phantom were performed to investigate these effects. The average lens dose was measured to be 0.077±0.006 Gy. This value is significantly lower than the 1-2% as predicated from the gamma knife treatment planning system. Using an empirical biological model, the probability of the lens complication was determined to be 0.1%. This low rate confirms our clinical findings that few TN patients develop cataracts.","Gamma knife; Sterotactic radiosurgery; Trigeminal neuralgia","Diseases; Dosimetry; Gamma rays; Mathematical models; Patient treatment; Radiation; Surgery; Tissue; Vision; Cataracts; Eye lens; Gamma knife radiosurgery; Sterotatic radiosurgery; Trigeminal neuralgia; Ophthalmology",,,,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0034443775

Materials and Methods: Five pediatric patients (four boys, one girl) with Alport's syndrome seen between 1993-1999 were included in this study. The clinical, histological, and genetic features as well as treatment were reviewed by medical records. Kidney biopsies were obtained from two patients. Results: Four patients were familial cases, and one male patient was a sporadic case. In the four boys, the first sign of the disease was hematuria. Proteinuria is variable, ranging from detectable in early stages to a nephrotic range in advanced stages. One patient with persistent nephritic range proteinuria went into renal insufficiency at the age of 8 years after being followed-up for 5 years. In the other boys, the symptomatology was limited to permanent hematuria and mild to heavy proteinuria. In the girl, the symptomatology was limited to permanent hematuria with mild proteinuria. The ophthalmologic evaluation failed to show lenticonus or macular flecks in our patients. Hearing impairment was noted in two boys at the age of 5 years. Conclusions: Patients with persistence of heavy proteinuria had a worse prognosis. Careful monitoring of renal function and early intervention for proteinuria are proposed for optimal preservation of kidney function.","Alport's syndrome; Hematuria; Hereditary nephritis; Proteinuria","cyclosporin; dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase inhibitor; prednisolone; steroid; Alport syndrome; article; female; hearing impairment; hematuria; human; kidney biopsy; kidney failure; male; ophthalmology; preschool child; prognosis; proteinuria",,"Chiou, Y.-Y.; Department of Pediatrics, National Cheng Kung University Hosp., 138 Sheng Li Road, Tainan, Taiwan",,,Article,"Final",,Scopus,2-s2.0-0033853184
